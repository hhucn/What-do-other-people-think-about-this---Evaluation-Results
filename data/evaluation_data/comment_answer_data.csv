With the same  situation occurring now for the opposite reason - the warming of the planet  making less of the earth habitable - unlike our ancestors, there is nowhere for people, like those living in the Horn of Africa, to go.  Already this is leading not only to poverty but also to deadly conflicts over resources, which will only increase.As humans accelerate climate change, population dislocation and armed conflict over basic resources likewise will accelerate.  Drought-stricken people aren't the only ones at risk.  Rapidly melting polar ice sheets already are raising sea levels, threatening the hundreds of millions of people who live in coastal cities world wide and in low-lying countries, like densely populated Bangladesh, the Netherlands, and a host of island nations.

That event did two things...the people there reminded me of a Christian fundamentalist event I went to with a friend when I was young, or a Native American pow-wow where the drumbeats were hypnotic. The Trump rally was like a cult gathering...blind devotion. The second thing was that my name is now on a Trump mailing list, and I get the weekly updates...they are basically re-election campaign emails full of empty rhetoric. I recently visited the WhiteHouse.gov website and almost cried at the difference from when Obama was president. It is now a symbol of a parallel universe so far from the truth or any actual facts that it is mind-boggling. I am a 70 yr old who became an American citizen when I was 7. I shall not live long enough to see our nation recover from the damage that this man and his sycophants have wrought upon us. The only bright shaft of hope comes from the fact that at least half of our country have been spurred to act in defense of our tenets and values that have made us proud to be Americans.

He had no idea how government works, from the structural realities of three branches of government to the complexities of policy making at home and the huge global and geopolitical threats. I think too about his astonishing comment at his press conference about uranium and the devastation of nuclear holocaust - it was as if he had never before understood the seriousness of nuclear confrontation. Learning about these realities as if for the first time is stunning to him and it's easy and politically expedient to blame his predecessor. Running the executive branch of the US government and running a family business are two very different things. The big problem that he is someone who is simultaneously opinionated, uninformed and incurious, thin-skinned, overwhelmed, and easily manipulated by those who know how to play him. He failed to read the job description for the position he eventually got, and now he is stunned by where he finds himself. ",emotion,11,True

As I said, natural systems do not react instantaneously to inputs and most of the CO2 has been input in the last 6 decades.  The most conservative projections by glaciologists who study Greenland and Antarctica is that the rate of increase is going to be non-zero this century. Besides, we know with great certainty that the last time CO2 was at 400 ppm, sea levels were 20 feet higher.  Also remember that sea level rise is not the only indicator of anthropogenic climate change. Temperature data from all over the planet demonstrate that.
