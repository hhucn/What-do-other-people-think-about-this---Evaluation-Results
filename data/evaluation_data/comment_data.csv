0,1,1,"Oh Gail...how I wish your column was longer so that you could have done an evaluation of all of DJT's ""accomplishments"" and appointees and hangers-on as well! I went to a Trump Rally because I wanted to see fellow members of the human race and try to understand what his appeal was.  That event did two things...the people there reminded me of a Christian fundamentalist event I went to with a friend when I was young, or a Native American pow-wow where the drumbeats were hypnotic. The Trump rally was like a cult gathering...blind devotion. The second thing was that my name is now on a Trump mailing list, and I get the weekly updates...they are basically re-election campaign emails full of empty rhetoric. I recently visited the WhiteHouse.gov website and almost cried at the difference from when Obama was president. It is now a symbol of a parallel universe so far from the truth or any actual facts that it is mind-boggling. I am a 70 yr old who became an American citizen when I was 7. I shall not live long enough to see our nation recover from the damage that this man and his sycophants have wrought upon us. The only bright shaft of hope comes from the fact that at least half of our country have been spurred to act in defense of our tenets and values that have made us proud to be Americans. I hope they have boundless energy, because I fear it is going to be a long effort to return to some kind of normalcy."
1,1,2,Trump didn't push Ryan over the edge. He might have given Ryan the courage to let everyone know even more clearly who he is.
2,1,3,"How to characterized those people who are either Trump staff, or congressmen and senators that are busy enacting his programs, and theirs.The question is, what do they get out of it? No one does anything for no reason. It may seem that way at times, but all his enablers have a motive. Spicer gives me the creeps. The first time I saw him speak I immediately thought Goebbels, but then Conway came on and they both fit the same mold. Now we also have Nunez, who comes from a district where the majority of residents can not vote. He is supported by some very wealthy raisin growers, This is Grapes of Wrath country, he has not had much opposition, Trump is his passport to bigger things, maybe a post in Siberia. And Ryan, he has had a dislike for anyone who has to rely on public assistance, except himself of course. So we have a whole menagerie of misfits and ideological nihilists getting their chance to see just how miserable they can make everyone else. They all need each other to do this. So if you wonder how any of them can stomach even being around Trump, they compliment each other.But that does not answer the question. We see a whole horde of opinions, speculation, even some sane ideas, and the usual answer is ""Follow the money."" But that does not seem to be the motive here. The other common comment is Fascism, they exhibit the characteristics of Il Duce, and others. We know Trump runs his organizations like that. They all want to keep the rest of us in line."
3,2,4,"Don't you lunatics ever stop. Your so called 'newspaper' has morphed into a 24/7 hate rag, spewing non stop bile toward Trump. Just like your campaign to deify Hillary as the most qualified candidate ever, your assault on Trump will boomerang. Frankly, I no longer read the NYT for serious news and commentary, but only for the entertainment value associated with seeing how stupid, paranoid and incoherent are the Times opinionators and 99% of published comments. I wrote a comment here in the summer of 2015, that Trump was likely to win the Presidency, prefaced by my declaration that 'you people don't get it'. You didn't get it then, you don't get it now, and you'll never get it going forward, because your understanding of human nature is stunted."
4,2,5,"Trump and the Trumpsters have damaged themselves, perhaps beyond repair. Kellyanne Conway is exhibit #1, rattling on through television interviews trying to fill in the blanks for facts she doesn't have and details on policies and changes to which she is not privileged. Steven Miller, the robotic college class president type who everyone loathes as soon as he starts speaking, is a strong candidate for #2. (You will not dispute this!)Apparently, Trump's daddy, nor anyone else, ever told him that if you have to brag about your accomplishments, then perhaps they weren't so great. Who cares now, besides him, about his vote in the Electoral College? He acts strong, feels weak and shows it constantly by talking about his greatness.One small comment to put this chaos in perspective: the early Bill Clinton White House was an unbelievable rolling disaster, too. They had no idea how to staff the place, vacuuming in dozens of people who had worked on the campaign, most under 30, who had never worked in govt. previously. I produced a couple of television segments with Clinton early on and my contact for these sessions was a guy with hair spiked upward who came down to walk me in dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. It was a thorough going mess with people barely older than college age taking part in debates, bull sessions, about weighty policy issues. The problem with Trump is that he appears to be utterly blind to the disastrous impression his new administration is making."
5,2,6,Trump is really a great role model for the youth of our country.  Boys and girls can better find their place by following his actions. 
6,3,7,"Anna North has it just right on the infinite lowliness of Trump. (Taking Note: Donald Trump’s Obsession With Applause)When the audience gave Navy SEAL Ryan Owens’s widow a standing ovation, Mr. Trump had to interlope, taking a scoundrel's refuge in the patriotic tragedy that he personally ordered with the botched Yemeni attack that made Mrs. Owens a widow.""Americans would do well to take Tuesday’s address not as a change of course for the president but as yet another example of one of his most entrenched traits: his willingness to say whatever he needs to say to get an audience to like him.""""He cares so much about what people think of him that he may not be able to imagine caring about anything else.“Ryan is looking down right now, you know that, and he’s very happy, because I think he just broke a record”...said Trump shamelessly as he wrapped himself in the flag while the soldier's family paid an unimaginable price.Ryan Owen is not 'very happy' now.He's dead.When not taking applause and credit for Ryan Owens, the so-called Commander-In-Chief Trump blamed the generals on Tuesday on Fox &amp; Friends:“This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something they wanted to do, They came to me, they explained what they wanted to do ― the generals ― who are very respected, my generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. And they lost Ryan.”https://tinyurl.com/jmftyxyYou can't go any lower than Donald Trump."

8,3,9,"Excellent article, well written and perceptive.Always considered Steve Bannon as one of the few people of quality serving the President. He struck me as a true RENAISSANCE man:naval officer,intellectual and author of 25 books, stock broker on the Street and a superb journalist. Also a workaholic, putting in long days at the WH, He also has a rough hewn, rugged charm, and his ""cheveux en bataille,""perpetually unshaven, only add to his magnetism.Trump seems intent on fulfilling the worst expectations of his critics, trashing the Office of the President by appointing as closest advisers his son in law and daughter.When Juliana and I lived in that decadent villa overlooking the Rio Nunes,in Boke, Guinea,we knew 20 something Peace Corps volunteers with more foreign policy experience than both Jared and Ivanka put together.This will not go down well with his dirt poor supporters who will view Trump as truly a false populist. Resentment is building. As Lady Packenham,paraphrasing Churchill, was wont to say, ""Nothing ever happens. Nothing ever stops happening.""Who could have foreseen that Jameson's Raid into the Transvaal in 1896 would result in the Boer War three years later. GOP may be in for a dreadful surprise come 2018."
9,4,10,"Millions of people voted for Trump because he ""wasn't a politician"". Today many of those same voters are falling all over themselves because he ""acted like a politician"". But neither really matters. Whether his persona du jour is reprehensible or rehearsed, he's still the same empty shell - spiritually, intellectually, and emotionally. "
10,4,11,"On ""I inherited a mess"" - I think this is just one more example of Trump's astonishment about the realities of his new job. He had no idea how government works, from the structural realities of three branches of government to the complexities of policy making at home and the huge global and geopolitical threats. I think too about his astonishing comment at his press conference about uranium and the devastation of nuclear holocaust - it was as if he had never before understood the seriousness of nuclear confrontation. Learning about these realities as if for the first time is stunning to him and it's easy and politically expedient to blame his predecessor. Running the executive branch of the US government and running a family business are two very different things. The big problem that he is someone who is simultaneously opinionated, uninformed and incurious, thin-skinned, overwhelmed, and easily manipulated by those who know how to play him. He failed to read the job description for the position he eventually got, and now he is stunned by where he finds himself. "

12,5,13,"Trump had the power to declassify.. said he did, so no classified documents.... Trump had the authority to take certain documents with him, so no document case.... Trump did not incite any violence... nor did he tell anyone to cheat... in Georgia he asked about the thousands of questionable and fraudulent ballots, those with fake addresses, those who had moved, those ballots that needed to be investigated and reviewed... which might have changed the results... and all of that was perfectly legal."
13,5,14,"Lol...wow...the nerve of the guy. Trump constantly lies and attacks fellow Republicans and you people start whining the second anyone says something you dont like. Typical. This is the precise reason 60% of voters will never vote for the guy. Trump hasnt had electoral success since 2016. He lost to a cadaver, is losing to a cadaver, and 2022 showed how unpopular he is. Yea...Im the moron"

15,6,16,"Roe was a compromise, and there are more compromises to be had. If the GOP were willing to ban all weapons that look like assault weapons, I'd be willing to say that abortion should unrestricted and on demand for the first 4.5 months of pregnancy, but seriously restricted after that. Everyone walks away unhappy, but lives would be saved and the country would be better for it. "
16,6,17,"C's, let's look at the numbers: In 2012, the CDC reported 1.3% of abortions at 21 weeks or later. That's about 13,000 pregnancy terminations.  For second trimester, Guttmacher reports that 10% of all abortions take place at 13 weeks or later. That's about 100,000 pregnancy terminations. Let's say 75% of those are are within 18 weeks of conception. That still leaves 25,000 terminations at 4.5 months or later (including, of course, the 13,000 late term, 3rd trimester terminations). Let's say 90% of these are to protect life of mother, rape, incest, or severe genetic disorder.  That still leaves 2,500 that are volitional. Total number of gun deaths in America due to assault weapons in average calendar year?  Huffpost figures about 180, with about double that many injuries.At least now we are talking about actual data. "
17,6,18,"It amazes me that any segment of our society considers forced gestation-- essentially, giving up a woman's right to control her own body and allowing another ""person"" to control it-- is acceptable.  Forced gestation is slavery.  We don't even force dead people to allow others to use their bodies, even if it will save their lives.  Why do you think women should have fewer rights than dead people? Think about it. "
18,10,28,"So, its become a numbers game. All those in favor of abortion raise your medical hands. Recall there was a ""medical consensus"" during COVID that was WRONG. Strange how some of us non-medical types knew that (see the real pandemic of 1918). The reality is the baby is a PERSON as DNA indicates separate from the parents as was known for thoouands of years. Then came the ""quickening"" argument at 3 months but the reality would not go away. Now, abortion up to birth. Slippery slope? Of course. Remember the adage ""Give then an inch and theyll take a mile"". Well, here it is. This is a child in the ealiest stages of development - period. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them LIFE . . .""

19,7,19,"If Medicare and Title X reimbursement were not available to patients of PP, PP would either be unable to do the procedure or would, in some cases, charge less money (and take the hit themselves).  Money would not be diverted from the provision of abortions and thus the provision of Medicare and Title X funds doesn't free money for abortions.  Where funds can't be transferred, they aren't fungible.  Your fungibility argument is simplistic and ill-considered.""Finally, your argument presupposes that abortions are available only via PP and nowhere else, a false assumption on its face. ""Your position is ill-informed.  Although PP only does a third of abortions, they are often the only local non-profit provider and can service poorer people that for-profit small clinics can't.  Further, it has been shown that when PP clinics close, other places don't pick up the slack, further substantiating that women who go to it for its services, including abortion, may not have a plethora of alternatives.  Thus, many women would be forced to carry a fetus to term.http://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9373721/planned-parenthood-go-somewhere-else"
20,7,20,"I suspect Trump has enabled a few abortions in his day. GW Bush supported one too. The hypocrisy is blinding.Meanwhile, nobody is blocking funding of male enhancements. If men got pregnant, this would all be different.Every sperm is sacred - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUspLVStPbkWomen and babies already born, not so much.Meanwhile, the health care for families, men, women and children, that is 97% of Planned Parenthood suffers. The lie that other clinics can and do provide similar care is appalling.So lives are only important before they are born. Whited sepulchers all."
21,7,21,"You're confused. A fetus does not have a right to use my body.  You can use ridiculous turns of phrase like ""lethal disposal rights"" all you want, but the reality of the situation is that the fetus is infringing on *my rights* by using *my body* without my permission. Therefore, I may remove it. "
22,8,22,"There is no restriction for abortions in the case of rape, incest or if the pregnancy risks the life of the mother. I think that's generous enough. Women have and always had full control over their bodies. You can choose who to sleep with, insist someone dons protection. Put yourself on the pill, take a plan B in the morning. Stay celibate.  So many choices. What republicans are against is the premeditated murder of an unborn child. Yes. Premeditated murder. Any woman who's had an abortion not due to one of the three reasons above is a murderer in the first degree. Stop trying to pass of your right to murder a true innocent as a step forward. If anything, it's more reminiscent of genital mutilation. A step several eras backward."

24,8,24,"I am both a mother of a gorgeous, bright 5 year old, and i am a woman who has had an abortion.I am grateful i live in a country where this is legal, where general practitioners are mostly non-judgmental and extremely helpful, where i can easily access safe abortion. Where i counselling is available to make such a (life altering) decision.To the people think my having had abortion affects them in some way or another, guess what? It doesnt'. Because you would never know as its none of your business.My body, my health, my choice.And when conservatives put the life of a 9 week old foetus ahead of the life and wellbeing of a grown woman their contempt for women is exposed."
25,9,25,"no one is pro abortion. Abortion has been around since the beginning of time. Our body can self abort. But it cannot go back to the dark rooms with criminals performing it. Sex Education,involved  parenting, easy access to birth control is a start to reduce this situation. Abortion is at an all time low. If you study the rest of the world, a woman being able to control reproduction lifts women and families out of poverty.  What I never hear is  an emphasis on helping women learn to control their reproduction abilities.Women are still blamed for their unplanned pregnancies; there is no involvement of the men. Mike Pence makes a mockery of my religion with his intolerance and people like him use Christianity to dictate to others how to live He has no understanding of how the rest of the world out there lives."
26,9,26,"Support for abortion in the US is decreasing because more people, particularly young people, are waking up to the reality of what abortion is, moving beyond the political rhetoric.Amazing 3-D ultrasound images show us that 16-, and 20-week old fetuses are not inert “clumps of cells” but are unmistakably living, moving human babies, no matter how small.People who see amazing images of operations performed on 20-week old babies in utero recognize that it is absurd to regard these beings as a patient in the context of fetal surgery and a worthless lump of flesh with no value or rights in the context of abortion.People also understand that abortion was sold to America on medical grounds 45 years ago, but the vast majority of abortions in the US today are performed for social and not medical reasons.More people are also recognizing the failure of the empty promises of the so-called ""sexual revolution"", which have left people more unhappy and alienated. Promoting promiscuity, contraception, and abortion in the 1960s and 1970s has left Americans worse off.People recognize that the radical Democratic Party platform position of abortion on demand up to the moment of birth paid for with public funds is also discordant with the beliefs of the vast majority of Americans.We should at least be able to agree on banning abortion after 20 weeks and ending dismemberment abortion."
27,9,27,"The anti-choice stance employed by the rightwing in America is simply a tool for obfuscation and division.They took the religious fervor and weaponized it for political gain only.They could care less about the fate of the women subjected to this, and nothing for the children- once they are born.That is why it is so obviously cruel.But keep a wary eye on what else they are up to while we fight this particular fire.  "
28,19,56,"Odd statement. One of Donald Trumps great appeals was ""what you see is what you got."" He was who he was, and wasnt putting on a persona to try to win votes."
29,19,57,"One thing about Donald Trump is that ""he is what he is"". Love him or hate him. He doesnt change personalities according to whichever group of people he is talking to."
30,10,29,"Most of the US has no idea what actually happens (by calculated design and deception) with an abortion, and if they did, all but the psycho/sociopaths would be totally against it. This is why Planned Parenthood and the progressives (both, on the commie-red left, and the labeled-red right) had to destroy Daleiden and bury all of the videos of the disgusting business and ""business dealings"". Abortion is only legal because of the deception perpetrated against the entire population, and especially directed at women ... at the most vulnerable moment in their life. Once the deception is uncovered, then the emotional and psychological healing of the trauma of abortion (which was intentionally directed at would-be mothers by the progressive left) can begin. Babies are good. Killing babies is bad. All is forgiven and every tear will be wiped away ... *if* we repent ,,, and *if* we turn away from the sin ,,, and go and sin no more."

32,11,31,"Ironically, many northern lands, where ghg are generated, are still rising from the absence of ice weight 10,000 or so years ago.  "
33,11,32,"All of the countries, the leadership class, had best contemplate what is coming.  From what I can see it's inevitable.  We're looking at sea level rise and, with the vast number of humans living along coastal areas all over this planet, a concomitant disaster of epic proportions is being set up.  Our leadership class; all of us for that matter, need to figure out a way to deal with a concomitant flood of humanity that will be spilling out and away from coastal areas.  You think we have an ""illegal"" immigration problem now?  You haven't seen nuthin' yet.  The forced migrations that are coming will be on an epic scale; almost biblical in their nature.  But this time all of it is not caused by God is it?

35,12,34,"Another fine article in this week's climate series. Though it starts out with a fictional premise, it moves on to presenting facts and the discussion of generational forgetfulness is interesting. We now compare the present to a more recent past, and forget earlier norms.200 feet is an interesting figure, because in fact in the various full ice melts in distant history were a bit over 200 feet, and you can see traces of this in various locations if you look for them. 216 feet, according to this NatGeo article, which also provides illustrations: http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2013/09/rising-seas-ice-melt-...Personally, I think it will be less than two decades before the consequences will be undeniable to the most resistant intelligence. Among other things, I worry about the breakdown of the power grid. Even now, there are more weeks long power outages in extreme weather.Some of that may be more reporting, but that easy access to information also blinds us to news that is not covered, like the recent floods in Iran and Azerbaijan, and South America (one of those was reported). There have been extremes in Chile that are affecting some of our food prices, but causing a devastating water crisis for people who live and farm there.Even without government misbehavior (Venezuela, Washington DC) we will have trouble."
36,12,35,"Americans will only pay attention to devastating climate events when they happen to them (e.g., Houston, New Orleans, Boston, Miami, NYC). The hue and cry will rise once there is a proven track record of recurring flooding in vulnerable parts of the U.S. coastal system. Unhappily, this is likely to occur sooner rather than later - and then, it will likely be too late for any remedies save the most expensive and disruptive ones."
37,12,36,"One must do what one can to alleviate suffering wherever one finds it. That being said, the climate is changing - has changed - and all humans on the planet will feel the repercussions. It is as inevitable the sun coming up in the morning and setting at night, for as long as our sun exists. "
38,13,37,"Jeff Guinn - No, I am not missing anything. As I said, natural systems do not react instantaneously to inputs and most of the CO2 has been input in the last 6 decades.  The most conservative projections by glaciologists who study Greenland and Antarctica is that the rate of increase is going to be non-zero this century. Besides, we know with great certainty that the last time CO2 was at 400 ppm, sea levels were 20 feet higher.  Also remember that sea level rise is not the only indicator of anthropogenic climate change. Temperature data from all over the planet demonstrate that. I would also point out that this paper is but one on the subject and other work shows an upward trending curve (aka acceleration: https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-level)http://www.pnas.org/content/113/11/E1434http://academics.eckerd.edu/instructor/hastindw/MS1410-001_FA08/handouts...The paper from PNAS looks back centuries and compared to previous centuries, the 20th century dwarfs sea level changes going back to the first century."
39,18,53,"A leader does not change his goals and principles to be political correct. We have not had anyone like that for decades until what was his name....oh yea Trump his goal is still the same MAGA. To keep us a democracy, and out of the totalitarian rule of the NWO. Understand this all your liberal haters of democracy, I am not a Trumper. I am not republican or democrat I am an American. Trump is an American 1st before he is a republican. He says thing other Americans have been saying before he ran in 2016. With out him in the HW again this nation will continue to do what the globalist want..collapse. "
40,18,54,"But rally attendance is pretty insignificant when it comes to the big picture. Sure, there are excited and committed fans on each side. Trump knows how to make a spectacle and draw a crowd. He has always been excellent at branding."
41,13,38,"More aptly, we should be discussing the rapid acceleration of climate change which human activity is causing because, as the Ice Ages evinced, climate has fluctuated naturally.The situation now is quite different from when the ice sheets advanced, when presumably our ancestors could migrate to more hospitable regions because the earth was thinly populated.   With the same  situation occurring now for the opposite reason - the warming of the planet  making less of the earth habitable - unlike our ancestors, there is nowhere for people, like those living in the Horn of Africa, to go.  Already this is leading not only to poverty but also to deadly conflicts over resources, which will only increase.As humans accelerate climate change, population dislocation and armed conflict over basic resources likewise will accelerate.  Drought-stricken people aren't the only ones at risk.  Rapidly melting polar ice sheets already are raising sea levels, threatening the hundreds of millions of people who live in coastal cities world wide and in low-lying countries, like densely populated Bangladesh, the Netherlands, and a host of island nations.  If we dramatically slow down the human contribution to climate change, AND take the challenge seriously, we will buy time to be able to find intelligent, inclusive adaptations to living on our planet with the natural changes in its climate."

43,14,40,"Yes, human beings are extremely adept at ignoring things that we don't want to deal with. It is, unfortunately, human nature to repress awareness of and anxiety about situations that seem hopeless or unchangeable. However, millions of people are acting to lower their carbon dependence and to wake others up to the terror of the situation...and the fact that the worst is not yet inevitable.Wherever you are reading this, there are people who are acting to avert climate catastrophe, and if you can't find them, you can find a thousand organizations online who would be grateful for your support. From the well known (Greenpeace and the Ocean Conservancy) to the cutting edge (2020 or Bust and Citizens' Climate Lobby) there is an organization you can join or contribute dollars to that is actively committed to averting climate disaster. It CAN be done, if enough of us are willing to do it. And as the late environmentalist Edward Abbey pointed out, there is an immediate reward to doing something: “Action is the antidote to despair.”  "
44,14,41,I am not surprised to find climate change at the root of the world’s troubles and President Trump responsible for it.  It is no wonder that people scoff at the notion of climate change and laugh at the liberal media who promote this nonsense.  Reality is bad enough without having to hype it.

Also remember that sea level rise is not the only indicator of anthropogenic climate change. Temperature data from all over the planet demonstrate that. I would also point out that this paper is but one on the subject and other work shows an upward trending curve (aka acceleration: https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-level)http://www.pnas.org/content/113/11/E1434http://academics.eckerd.edu/instructor/hastindw/MS1410-001_FA08/handouts...The paper from PNAS looks back centuries and compared to previous centuries, the 20th century dwarfs sea level changes going back to the first century."
46,15,43,"I first started to read newspaper articles about climate, back in the early 70’s . At that time, they were warning about the coming ice age! They couldn’t sell that at all, so they switched to global warming! That lasted a couple of decades, until it was reported that the planet’s temperature hadn’t really budged! Then they came up with the generic term, climate change! This could now be used for any and all extreme weather! Today, they’re pushing it for another reason and it doesn’t bode well for Americans!"
47,15,44,"Climate changes. It is a constant process, and has been going on for at least a few billion years. Climate changes, and ours is no exception. The climate of today will not be the climate of the next decade, and a 1000 years from now earth may be near unrecognizable."
48,15,45,"Americans will only pay attention to devastating climate events when they happen to them (e.g., Houston, New Orleans, Boston, Miami, NYC). The hue and cry will rise once there is a proven track record of recurring flooding in vulnerable parts of the U.S. coastal system. Unhappily, this is likely to occur sooner rather than later - and then, it will likely be too late for any remedies save the most expensive and disruptive ones."

Just like he said to go to the Capitol peacefully and patriotically to have your voices heard. The Washington press has been inbreeding with the Washington insiders for a hundred years. They no longer act as an honest and objective press to keep the government honest, Instead, they now act as the propaganda arm meant to turn all of the power and money and control over to the powerful. That is why they also supported sweeping fraud claims and calls for audits of the contested states under the rug without ever shining a light on them. You should be ashamed of pushing the the fake race bs that does nothing but divide America into racial groups. If you guys would stop playing sick race games we could actually come together as one human race and one nation. Wake up."

He wanted Sarah Sanders job and didnt get it. He embarrassed her numerous times on twitter, about her appearance..WHILE working with her. It was uncalled for. Hes a rude little pygmy. Nobody liked him. We ALL hated him. He has likely ALWAYS voted democrat, just like his heroes, Bush and Romney."

59,20,60,"      It's not exactly sufficient simply to pin a racist tag on all of Trump supporters.  A lot of Trump supporters voted for him because they continue to be infuriated by what they perceive as the moral chaos of the Democratic left.   The problem is that some of his supporters do not perceive that the deep cynicism of his politics is based on his passion for self-glorification, the utter debasement of his pretentious manipulation of the religious right.  These people are victims of their own self-deception.  It is, however, true that a big portion of his supporters--who knows what fraction?--actually share the cynicism, including the racism.  This is what makes a serious analysis of his political support so maddeningly complex and insidious.      "
60,21,61,It died the minute Trump became the leader of the party. He is anything but “conservative”
61,21,62,"In your case yes, post partum. Like soon."
62,21,63,"Yes, it appears to be ""losing"" as more and more women are sold the bill of goods called Feminism, of which abortion is wrapped up in. Legally, there should be consistency, which is if only the woman can ""decide"" about whether to have or not have the baby, then the man should also have the the same decision; he should also have the ""choice"" of whether or not he supports the baby. Currently, all the ""rights"" are bestowed on the woman. If she wants the baby, she gets to keep it and then sue the man for support. If she wants to kill the baby, then she has the right, even if the man doesnt want this for his child. In law, we have a concept called ""consent"" and that is a mutual condition. I further believe that if they couple is not married, the man has no right to claim fatherhood and participate in the childs life (unless he wants to) nor does he have the financial obligation (unless he also wants to). That would put a stop to some reckless behavior. But, unfortunately, BIG ABORT business has bought a lot of power, buying off politicians. They also never just stop at a private decision to abort. Abort immediately drifts from, if it is legal and a right, then someone else must pay, which means, my sons who had no pleasure of the womens company, are obligated to pay for killing of babies not theirs. Remember, legal doesnt mean moral and moral doesnt mean legal, although our laws are based on Judeo-Christian morals (for the time being, but the Sharia folks are hell-bent on changing all that, and just look at their cultures and countries!). Women want ""equity"" or ""equality"" then they should take the full responsibility for their ""reproductive choices."""
63,22,64,"Ah . . . so that case in Texas WASNT about the ""health of the mother"" at all. It was about the fact that the baby was handicapped. And tiny handicapped babies dont deserve protection from the abortionists curette."
64,22,65,"I suspect Trump has enabled a few abortions in his day. GW Bush supported one too. The hypocrisy is blinding.Meanwhile, nobody is blocking funding of male enhancements. If men got pregnant, this would all be different.Every sperm is sacred - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUspLVStPbkWomen and babies already born, not so much.Meanwhile, the health care for families, men, women and children, that is 97% of Planned Parenthood suffers. The lie that other clinics can and do provide similar care is appalling.So lives are only important before they are born. Whited sepulchers all."
65,22,66,"I have been thinking for sometime that anti-abortion views are very much akin to slavery, in that somebody wants to own your body. I don't speak about this because, as a white woman, I don't want to  offend and underestimate the horrors and evil  of  the American slave trade    But there it is: if someone tries to own your body, it's slavery."
66,23,67,"There is no restriction for abortions in the case of rape, incest or if the pregnancy risks the life of the mother. I think that's generous enough. Women have and always had full control over their bodies. You can choose who to sleep with, insist someone dons protection. Put yourself on the pill, take a plan B in the morning. Stay celibate.  So many choices. What republicans are against is the premeditated murder of an unborn child. Yes. Premeditated murder. Any woman who's had an abortion not due to one of the three reasons above is a murderer in the first degree. Stop trying to pass of your right to murder a true innocent as a step forward. If anything, it's more reminiscent of genital mutilation. A step several eras backward."
67,23,68,"Ah . . . so that case in Texas WASNT about the ""health of the mother"" at all. It was about the fact that the baby was handicapped. And tiny handicapped babies dont deserve protection from the abortionists curette."
68,23,69,"Good that there are people that make a very sensible nuance: in the Netherlands f.i. (to many Americans such a liberal country) one doesn't speak of birth CONTROL, one speaks of anti-conception, because it there, right before the ""act"" were responsabilities start. (Young) People are very much aware how to prevent pregnancy, anti-conception is accessible to everyone, and we have among the lowest abortion rates in the world! Abortion is always possible within the first 3 months of pregnancy, at a later period of time, there have to be medical, psychological or other severe reasons (as in the case of rape). And we did't have discussions like in the US. So we have the right of abortion, AND the rights of the unborn child well protected.  "
69,24,70, “It’s just tissue dividing or clumps of cells in the first trimester” is a blatant lie that has been sold since the 70s. Women are grieving abortions after learning truth too late. Raising a child that had a sibling they terminated takes a toll on their sole.
70,24,71,"I wouldn't hope or even try to convince you that abortion isn't premeditated murder. You are expressing the religious view that life begins at conception, and that an embryo has a fully formed soul. Most of us don't believe that. If we did, then every 8 cell embryo that miscarried unnoticed would be unbaptized and forever damned. If we believed that, thee could be no abortion exceptions, not for rape or for incest.But we don't believe that. In fact, most of us are horrified at the brutality of forcing an eleven year child raped by her uncle to endure pregnancy and childbirth. Viewing abortion as murder is a religious view which doesn't listen to argument or reason.  You  are certainly entitled to believe that and you may live your life accordingly. What you are not entitled to is impose your religion on the rest of us who do not believe that the thing that makes us different from a tree or a dog or a bean, the thing we call a soul,  comes into existence the moment a sperm cell hits the side of an egg cell.And we all have to live together.  Catholics, Muslims, Protestants, Jews, Atheists and Agnostics, Hindus and the whole rest of the tribes.  The only way we can make this work is to leave government out of religion and religion out of government."
71,24,72,"Most of the US has no idea what actually happens (by calculated design and deception) with an abortion, and if they did, all but the psycho/sociopaths would be totally against it. This is why Planned Parenthood and the progressives (both, on the commie-red left, and the labeled-red right) had to destroy Daleiden and bury all of the videos of the disgusting business and ""business dealings"". Abortion is only legal because of the deception perpetrated against the entire population, and especially directed at women ... at the most vulnerable moment in their life. Once the deception is uncovered, then the emotional and psychological healing of the trauma of abortion (which was intentionally directed at would-be mothers by the progressive left) can begin. Babies are good. Killing babies is bad. All is forgiven and every tear will be wiped away ... *if* we repent ,,, and *if* we turn away from the sin ,,, and go and sin no more."
72,25,73,"Ah . . . so that case in Texas WASNT about the ""health of the mother"" at all. It was about the fact that the baby was handicapped. And tiny handicapped babies dont deserve protection from the abortionists curette."
73,25,74,"The very opposite is true. Abortion is a morally complex issue for a large number of reasons. The nature of personhood; individual moral choice; the influence of duress on pregnancy through rape, incest, sexual violence; the conflict of mother and pre born rights; the incursion of State upon personal choice; the availability of social support services, amongst other things."
74,25,75,"This decision is absolutely staggering in it's INTENDED consequences. This is what happens when ""deeply held religious beliefs"" supersede common sense. You don't need multiple studies to predict the outcome of this deplorable ruling - HUMAN BEINGS will suffer and die in the name of a God who (if he even exists) is weeping at what we are doing to each other.Whatever happened to the FIRST amendment? Do we live in a theocracy, with ""Christian Sharia Law?""Women will NOT be dragged back to the Middle Ages!There is a massive movement to defund Planned Parenthood. On 2/11 there will be demonstrations outside PP clinics. http://protestpp.com/locations/ A friend of mine has pledged to donate $1 to PP for every PRO-ABORTION protester that shows up at our local clinic. I am far from wealthy but I will do the same. How about you? How much will you pledge? "

With the Sun revolving around an earth that is but 4,372 years old, we know from the written record that climate change is a local matter caused by creator wrath at unremediated-inherited sin. I have never met any scientist who believes in climate change. I was reminded by a science teacher that the last occurrence of verifiable global warming was when the sun stood still for an extra day. Sea levels did not increase then.I will admit there was a time when sea levels rose too  Rain was the reason - the dome that separates the waters from the earth broke open.  There is a simple experiment you can do at home that proves that cracks in the dome that separates the waters from the earth and not global warming are the cause of any increase in water levels. Drop ice cubes into a pitcher of water.  When the ice melts the water level in the pitcher goes down slightly.  Next, Take a plastic storage bag filled to water on top of the same pitcher of water.  Poke a hole in the plastic bag and allow the water to drain into the pitcher.  The water level in the pitcher will rise. "

82,28,83,"MScott and other deniers:Obviously there are experts who can cast doubt on anything.  The same people worked for big tobacco for many years, denying that nicotine is addictive, questioning what addiction even is, denying that smoking is bad for your health.  Those people are not interested in science.  They are interested in making money (paid by big tobacco) from the people who sell cigarettes.  And for many years, and today, people doubt that smoking is bad for you.  Success!   But disinterested parties from all over the world, whose interest is in science and the its benefits for humanity, who are sounding the alarm that rising CO2 levels will result in catastrophe, and is even now resulting in catastrophe (severe injury, death, property destruction) from violent storms and rising seas.  Even a denier has to admit that perturbing a closed system will affect that system.  Here, the closed system is Earth, and the perturbation is jacking up atmospheric CO2 levels.  We know the properties of CO2 with respect to heat-trapping.  Scientists collect the data and model it.  The world agrees-human activity causes climate change.  Rex Tillerson (but not his secret email alias) might publicly deny it, because they stand to lose money otherwise.  Who are you going to believe?"
83,28,84,"Since carbon dioxide levels have risen in the atmosphere, we have seen greening in previously arid regions like the Sahel and South West India. This is because higher levels of CO2 make plants more drought resistant. So its not just greenhouses; the entire Earth benefits fro higher CO2."
