0,1,"This is a funny column.  But seriously folks, there is a long, long history of people dealing with/associating with Trump who have come to regret it (truly, deeply regret it).  People he had contracts with, business people who worked for him/with him, politicians (especially in Atlantic City), people who live anyplace near him (especially his golf resorts, did those poor people in Scotland ever get that spite wall taken down?), and just about everybody who went to trump university.

3,4,"Trump had never been considered a racist until the Washington press started playing their standard race games. They always tell you that Trump defended ""fine white supremacists"" when he said exactly the opposite. You could look these things up your self but you instead feed on the hatred of the entrenched political class.
