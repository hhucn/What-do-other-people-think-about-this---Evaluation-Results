I remain flummoxed by the Democratic Party's inability to rightfully seize the issue of ""life"" away from Republicans, including the so-called Christian Right.

No Democratic candidate should ever believe he or she has to defend abortion.  It is no more a moral ""good"" than divorce.

Driving in your car for a pleasant walk around a lake--instead of, say, riding your bike there--is not going to help the situation, however. Nor will you convert anyone who doesn't believe in climate change by dropping snide, smug comments about their fearless leader. <br/><br/>As my mamaw used to say, you'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. I'd have thought someone from Tennessee would have known that already. This column is a master exercise in rhetoric that speaks only to the NYTimes clickbait choir.
