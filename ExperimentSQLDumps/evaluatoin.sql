1	Pence's poodle? Pence's Pomeranian? Pence's Pekingese? Nah. How about pence and half-pence?	1
2	Two really dangerous people are the Minister of Ideology, bannon and the Mistress of Propaganda, conway. Whereas trump just makes stuff up and truly can't distinguish lies from truth, bannon is a belligerent fascist and conway knownly lies about everything. Certainly possible that pence is the third component of the junta that's currently occupying the White House.	1
3	Pence, Trump, and Gorsuch: prepare for an assault on Thomas Jefferson's great Wall of Separation between Church and State.	1
4	(Continued from previous post). We conservatives (in the original sense of wanting to conserve our wonderful heritage) want the environment to be protected, for climate change to be acknowledged and dealt with, for government dealings to be transparent, for science to be respected, and for conflicts of interest to be fully disclosed.  We expect our government to be fiscally responsible.  There is nothing 'leftist' or partisan about these positions, which not long ago were espoused by many Republicans in public office.When you don't state your own views on these issues, and how you might disagree with the Trump administration on some of them, you come across as merely an articulate partisan.  Would you join me in an open discussion of the above issues?  Does it trouble you that virtually no Republicans express independent views on these topics?	2
5	Tim Wu may find Trump’s idiocy benign...just getting attention..no real harm done?Trump dug down and allowed all the white haters to surface with impunity.  Trump refused to dismiss the white supremacists in his base.  David Duke who?Douglas County is a few miles over from me here in Georgia.  Just outside the perimeter of metro Atlanta and has a high percentage of African-American who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012.To start off Georgia has no “hate crime” statute.  You know the “good ole boys jest havin’ fun!”“Torres, 26, and Norton, 25, had been part of a group of 15 people calling itself ‘Respect the Flag.' On July 24, on 2015, they began a rampage through neighboring Paulding County. With Confederate battle flags attached to their trucks, they threatened African-American motorists and shoppers at a local Walmart.”"911 call centers were flooded with calls. The next day they kept up their campaign and happened upon  a party with African-Americans...BD party for 8-year-old child. The yard was full of friends and family when Torres and their crew began hurling racial slurs at the party goers and threatening them WITH A LOADED 12 GAUGE SHOTGUN POINTED AT THE 8 Y/O.”http://www.ajc.com/news/local/douglasville-hate-crime-victim-defendants-...Trump’s influence?  The Northern Mississippi chapter of the KKK is protesting the 20 years and 13 year sentences of the white couple today...HERE!!!I’ve never seen the Klan before today	2
6	Mr. Brooks I would agree with you if were not at such a critical juncture for our country and planet.When even the slightest turns can have dire consequences for the type of country we will be, and the habitable planet we leave to our children.Firstly, turning to the fantasy of a past which never really existed as a vision for a future which will demand different skills from workers is shortsighted and a disservice to those struggling with the changes of a global economy, needing different skills, more education, and the understanding to work in an interconnected world. Promising 20th century manufacturing and 19th century mining jobs will benefit no one.Secondly, he has made common cause with racists and bigots of many stripes,and is a misogynist all his own. From his selection of Sessions and Gorsuch, and his lily white almost all male cabinet. He proves in every photo op a world view woefully out of date. And one of the more glaring deficiencies of their mindset is how they fundamentally don't understand America's moral leadership role in the global community. We are not perfect, but we aspire to be better.Thirdly, and much more frightening is burying they're heads in the quickly eroding sand. As President Obama realized, if the planet we live on becomes progressively less hospitable to our form of life, we have no where to go. We are now living in that rapidly closing window of a chance to do something about it.	2
7	Why wouldn't the Democrats do some aggressive mindsharing of their own?How's David Brock doing?Who is the next Al Gore, who this time around will make the new Current TV a thundering success?Why don't they start their campaign early, that is now, today, with bimonthly "Mandate of the Popular Majority Debates" in Honor of Hillary Clinton?Imagine all the people... of the popular majority unsuppressed, un(FBI)lettered and unfettered by the ugly true face that is now being revealed by the current administration, its strong numbers revealed by the current so called ruler's staggering disapproval ratings (for whom would this be tacit no explicit approval and support?;-), they need some good mindsharing entertainment and celebration events of their own.These Mandate of the Popular Majority Debates should be largely displays of unity the coming two years.Let's rock and roll.As I said in an earlier comment up here,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/sunday/how-donald-trump-wins-b...,I hope Oprah Winfrey will join.The Democrats should start to sell paraphernalia now, and who can sell like her?And I'm hoping Elizabeth Warren will jump in.

8	As a civil servant in the last 3 administrations one of the only things I have been thrilled about in this one is the lack of political appointees. In my experience during both Bush and Obama we often had lots of well meaning political colleagues who had none of the appropriate skills to successfully make or negotiate policy. In my department we now have senior career officials filling in for where we've usually had political hacks and they are far more efficient and knowledgeable about how to fill senior roles in the government, based on their decades of service.	3
25	I have worked with people like Trump, managers and coworkers,  superficial people obsessed with the  pursuit of attention for its own sake. Every simple event or action was a drama, every corporate decision was an personal affront, every question was a challenge. Eventually the act grows tiresome and the simply fade away, either fired, laid off or transferred to some obscure backwater.While Trump may be winning the rhetorical Twitter war with absurd conspiracies and rancor  ( I'm not sure exactly what he is winning) by mid summer the Trump dog and pony show will grow ever more tiresome. By then there will be, I'm hopeful, some actual legislation passed like the replacement  for the ACA. There is no possible way  Congress can deliver what Trump has promised. Also Congress will push "entitlement" reform for Medicare and Social Security as part of the budgetary process., programs that Trump said were sacrosanct during the campaign and as late as last Wenesday. No amount of insane tweets and slight of hand will diminish the seething anger from his betrayed supporters.	9

10	This phrase in the column fails to note the reality: "...a Republican Party that’s...internally divided...".The Republican party on Capitol Hill, especially in the House, is at war with itself. Since the elections of 2010, it has been dominated by a group of people who neither know how to legislate nor care to learn. They see their purpose as blocking everything and then swooping back to their gerrymandered districts for whoops of praise. Unless or until the Republicans decide to kick them back, take them down many notches, very little of anything that might draw wide approval is possible.As for Trump's choices to lead various cabinet departments, he and his team have heard the buzzer but failed to come out on the court to play. He has nominated only 7% of the 530 sub-cabinet and other positions required of any president, 37 out of 530. He takes ignorance of the functioning of government as a badge of honor saying, in effect, what do we need all these people far? Meanwhile, it is safe to assume that hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are being wasted in agencies without leadership or direction. These are the kinds of ordinary things his cheering crowds know or care nothing about at all.The American public, through the Electoral College, put a forcefully, determinedly ignorant man in the White House. If you would like to get the full impact of that massive ignorance, read the AP interview with Trump from earlier this week.http://tinyurl.com/ldqk7w8	4
11	Feeling a wee bit sorry for yourself this morning, Mr. Brooks? I don't recall any of this purgative wailing and teeth-gnashing about the state of the United States presidency when Barack Obama was in office. When was that? A thousand years ago? Today, your theme is incompetence; allow me to count some ways.I absolve you of Donald Trump. To your credit, you did see this coming and were chilled at the possibilities. But along the way, your columns dropped the scent of doubt along the way. The incompetence that you so utterly loathe today was apparent in the digs at President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. I don't suppose one would be unkind enough (certainly not I!) to remind you that your party (not to mention our country) is headed by a man who has so thoroughly fouled and slimed the title of "president of the United States" that it could be read in the same paragraph that catalogues the worst sort of human being: thief; panderer; seducer; liar; schemer; defrauder. And today, with American instruments of death and destruction now raining down on a foreign country that has not declared war on us, murderer and death-dealer.Donald Trump, sir, is what happens when a country has lain in the frying pan (picture an egg) for a quarter of a millennium and hasn't been turned over. When attempting to do so, one finds it impossible to scrape the underside of the egg off the sizzling pan. It's a dripping, inedible mess, isn't it?Behold the Republican party's president!	4
12	Granted, the president is a certified threat to national security and domestic tranquility.  He’s got his share of clueless supporters, but he seems to have a far larger share of sensible citizens who are less concerned about their liberal dream than they are terrified of a looming apocalyptic nightmare.  The president’s agenda changes from minute to minute.  He rambles incoherently at a news conference in which the only news was the odd behavior and rambling accusations that were spewing forth from our commander-in-chief.Things aren’t getting better.  It’s only been a month, and already he can’t keep his own lies straight.  He’s becoming more unhinged as the stresses increase and the pressures compound.  When he breaks, it will be sudden and catastrophic.Republicans in Congress must put their misguided glee at being in the majority on hold.  They’ve got to work with Democrats to form a unified opposition to the president, and to communicate to the White House that this administration is not sustainable.The emperor is naked on a world stage.  He’s not respected by world leaders.  Putin laughs at him as Russian spy boats prowl our shores.  He’s not going to look out for the resentful folks in fly-over communities who think he’s got their backs.  He’d sooner feed them to the wolves of Wall Street than look at them.  He’s an existential threat to our democracy, and he must be stopped.Repeal and replace is the only option.	4
13	Trump and the Trumpsters have damaged themselves, perhaps beyond repair. Kellyanne Conway is exhibit #1, rattling on through television interviews trying to fill in the blanks for facts she doesn't have and details on policies and changes to which she is not privileged. Steven Miller, the robotic college class president type who everyone loathes as soon as he starts speaking, is a strong candidate for #2. (You will not dispute this!)Apparently, Trump's daddy, nor anyone else, ever told him that if you have to brag about your accomplishments, then perhaps they weren't so great. Who cares now, besides him, about his vote in the Electoral College? He acts strong, feels weak and shows it constantly by talking about his greatness.One small comment to put this chaos in perspective: the early Bill Clinton White House was an unbelievable rolling disaster, too. They had no idea how to staff the place, vacuuming in dozens of people who had worked on the campaign, most under 30, who had never worked in govt. previously. I produced a couple of television segments with Clinton early on and my contact for these sessions was a guy with hair spiked upward who came down to walk me in dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. It was a thorough going mess with people barely older than college age taking part in debates, bull sessions, about weighty policy issues. The problem with Trump is that he appears to be utterly blind to the disastrous impression his new administration is making.	5
14	President Trump is right as usual. The only thing I add to is Biden needs to FIRE 🔥 in a first place. There is nobody in that administration who has any clue what is going on. Biden does know if Jill changer his diaper. 	5

16	There's another article today about Jared.  But you raise a good question nonetheless.	6
17	Trump is simply opportunistic. Or as the old saying goes, now that Curiel is a good judge, the end justifies the means. But I wonder, if pressed on his earlier statement of Judge Curiel as “very hostile,” “a very bad judge” and a “hater of Donald Trump,” and he “should be ashamed of himself. I think it’s a disgrace that he’s doing this.” if Trump would say - "See, I was right. I chastised him and he didn't dare rule against me again."? 	6
18	One thing is missing from both the editorial and comments so I will state it here-“another judge legislating from the bench”.  It is comical whenever a ruling is against our Dear Leader he and his easily conned followers will start that screech.  So, I just had to say it.	6

20	Mr. Brooks I would agree with you if were not at such a critical juncture for our country and planet.When even the slightest turns can have dire consequences for the type of country we will be, and the habitable planet we leave to our children.Firstly, turning to the fantasy of a past which never really existed as a vision for a future which will demand different skills from workers is shortsighted and a disservice to those struggling with the changes of a global economy, needing different skills, more education, and the understanding to work in an interconnected world. Promising 20th century manufacturing and 19th century mining jobs will benefit no one.Secondly, he has made common cause with racists and bigots of many stripes,and is a misogynist all his own. From his selection of Sessions and Gorsuch, and his lily white almost all male cabinet. He proves in every photo op a world view woefully out of date. And one of the more glaring deficiencies of their mindset is how they fundamentally don't understand America's moral leadership role in the global community. We are not perfect, but we aspire to be better.Thirdly, and much more frightening is burying they're heads in the quickly eroding sand. As President Obama realized, if the planet we live on becomes progressively less hospitable to our form of life, we have no where to go. We are now living in that rapidly closing window of a chance to do something about it.	7
21	Trump is a great man and he has already begun to make America great again as we saw yesterday when he addressed the crew of the USS Gerald Ford. 	7
22	I have lived here all my 62 years and I agree with  RAIx86 whom you were commenting about. I was in Paris traveling the day after the election. ( and did early voting), and a personal working at my hotel made a very wise comment. He said " France can have a bad president, Germany, Spain but when the USA does it effects the whole world"	8
23	There is one thing that no one has mentioned here: A majority of us 'Other' Americans are on to him and will monitor his every action over the next four years ( that is he if the Trumpster makes it that long). His presidency has awakened the silent- apathetic and 'non- political' throughtout our nation. In specific reference to his state of the union speech:  'Actions speak louder than words'.	8
24	Donald Trump earned his chops in NYC on the hot griddle of lurid tabloid, NY Post Page 6-type media that fed him the endless attention that his infantile, megalonarcissitic personality required and desired. He learned his lessons well. He has found that lessons learned there also work on the mainstream media as well. And worked on the gritty, angry, vengeful, hopeful audience, I mean populace, that elected him. People keep underestimating Donald Trump. I agree that it is both his strength and inevitably, his weakness. As long as you keep in mind that this guy and his minions aren't going anywhere soon. The Republicans and his base won't let it happen. And Trump sells too much advertising.  We think of checks and balances as a troika (a term not used accidentally) - Presidential, Legislative, Judicial.  Journalism, the Fourth Estate, represents the fourth, and presently, the last, best check and balance.My fear is that even if Trump goes down in flames it won't make much of a difference. By the time it might happen, the ravages that The Trump administration and the icy cold Republican majority in the House and Senate will have inflicted upon the American people could take a generation - or two to undue. Or not possible to undue at all.	8
26	Once again, Mr. Brooks tries to make up a reality that is off the mark.Trump himself has indeed proved to be all bluff and bluster, with no discipline or vision beyond trivial self-aggrandizement. But he's no harmless lightweight pond-skimmer. He and the people around him are causing enormous damage to the country and the presidency.It's true that he's proven to be unable to persuade anyone to do anything, but the people who are handing him executive orders to sign, are hobbling and dismantling the Federal government and the progress that it's made over the last 25 years.And it's only a matter of time before his Supreme Court appointee(s) tip the Court to rule in favor of the Muslim ban and against sanctuary cities and the rights of women and minorities. Across the world, Trump's macho posturing will result in strengthening of our rivals and further misery for millions of people who have heretofore benefited from American aid programs and moral leadership.And Trump is cheapening and corrupting American idea of the Presidency.  He's destroyed the concept of the Presidency as a sacred office of public service, and turned it into a scheme for the benefit of himself and his family.  And perhaps most bizarre, is the flood of blatant brazen lies the Trump and his people put out every day.  This is not a small matter. Other serious commentators have warned about the destruction of the very notion of objective truth and its replacement by pure demagoguery.	9
27	What America has seen is a desperate, psychopathic  who is at best an owned and manipulated puppet of Russian interests, and at worst an agent of that regime, and specifically Vladimir Putin.  Trump's service and concentration  since taking office has had but one coherent tactical thread, to sow chaos and disruption throughout the West - in a continuation of the pattern set by his election campaign, which took time out to campaign pro-Brexit, another enterprise funded, apparently in part by Russia.  He has also verbally assaulted our allies in West Germany and elsewhere.Trump is a traitor.  Before assuming office, through Mike Flynn,  Trump conveyed that U.S. intelligence sourced from high in the FSB was being circulated tracing their interference in our media and election.  Russia promptly and dramatically arrested its own bureau chiefs thought to be responsible for those leaks. In an incredible press conference,, Vladimir Putin jerked hard on the leash connected to Trump's dog collar, bragging, "Moscow prostitutes are the best  in the world," while 'denying' that Trump was seduced and urinated upon in a Moscow Hotel arranged diversion while orchestrating his "Miss Universe Contest" there.  On taking office 1-20-2017, Trump immediately fired senior DOS staff throughout Western Europe, further throwing U.S intelligence in chaos.  The next day he visited the CIA and gave a gloating speech, whose ostensible purpose was to 'reassure our intelligence community.' 	9
28	Trump will win, but the entire Washington establishment, the DOJ, the media, and even the GOP will undermine him. I will still vote for him, but Its going to be bad	10
29	Its debatable if the 2020 election was on the up and up. Lets assume it was and Trump loses to Biden. Trump isnt humiliated. Biden won because of the stupidity of voters. Thats not Trumps fault. Now several years later and look what harm Biden has maliciously done to America. You and I experience humiliation. Trump, the multibillionaire, does not get humiliated. He knows he is a winner and has shown it running an international real estate empire.	10
30	Anna North has it just right on the infinite lowliness of Trump. (Taking Note: Donald Trump’s Obsession With Applause)When the audience gave Navy SEAL Ryan Owens’s widow a standing ovation, Mr. Trump had to interlope, taking a scoundrel's refuge in the patriotic tragedy that he personally ordered with the botched Yemeni attack that made Mrs. Owens a widow."Americans would do well to take Tuesday’s address not as a change of course for the president but as yet another example of one of his most entrenched traits: his willingness to say whatever he needs to say to get an audience to like him.""He cares so much about what people think of him that he may not be able to imagine caring about anything else.“Ryan is looking down right now, you know that, and he’s very happy, because I think he just broke a record”...said Trump shamelessly as he wrapped himself in the flag while the soldier's family paid an unimaginable price.Ryan Owen is not 'very happy' now.He's dead.When not taking applause and credit for Ryan Owens, the so-called Commander-In-Chief Trump blamed the generals on Tuesday on Fox &amp; Friends:“This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something they wanted to do, They came to me, they explained what they wanted to do ― the generals ― who are very respected, my generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. And they lost Ryan.”https://tinyurl.com/jmftyxyYou can't go any lower than Donald Trump.	10
31	This article and similar articles that conclusively argue man made climate change and the detrimental effect it has world wide will have no positive influence  on Donald Trump because Donald Trump does not have a soul.	11
32	Why is discussion of climate change politically correct but discussion of explosive population growth is taboo?  Africa's population has gone from about 285 million total to 1.3 billion today to 4.4 billion by 2100.  Africa has got to get its fertility under control.	11
33	The vitriol of many of the comments on Nick Kristof's column is shocking to me.Of course, one can disagree, though I am convinced that there is a human cause behind climate change because of excessive carbon emissions.  May there be additional causes?  It would seem so.But even with room for adding other causes, the extreme language and thought in some of these comments is disheartening.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised given what the President-elect is spewing, but I am nonethelsss saddened.Can't on disagree without being savage?	11
34	This is at the root, too, of why over a decade ago the Pentagon started labeling climate change as the number one threat to our national security. With impoverished populations will come massive migrations, unsettled and angry populaces, and eventual pandemics.Thank you for presenting us with some of the human faces on the front lines of human caused suffering.	12
35	Sad indeed that people are starving while there is enough food in this world and so much of it goes wasted.The countries listed are corrupt dictatorships that leadership doesn't really care if the people starve. I can't agree with Kristof's cheap stab at Israel's foreign aid. The aid the US gives Israel comes back to benefit us many times over. Firstly Israel needs to spend 80% of the aid money in the USA thereby keeping our defense industries strong and jobs in America.  Secondly Israel shares it's technological developments that enhance our own security to properly defend ourselves. In speaking with US Congressional Members of the House Intelligence Committee I was told the intelligence that Israel provides us daily is precious and the aid we provide is a bargain for what our government gets back. We need more friends like Israel that give back a lot more then they get. If Kristof is writing about food aid bashing Israel's aid has no place in his Op-Ed piece.	12
36	More aptly, we should be discussing the rapid acceleration of climate change which human activity is causing because, as the Ice Ages evinced, climate has fluctuated naturally.The situation now is quite different from when the ice sheets advanced, when presumably our ancestors could migrate to more hospitable regions because the earth was thinly populated.   With the same  situation occurring now for the opposite reason - the warming of the planet  making less of the earth habitable - unlike our ancestors, there is nowhere for people, like those living in the Horn of Africa, to go.  Already this is leading not only to poverty but also to deadly conflicts over resources, which will only increase.As humans accelerate climate change, population dislocation and armed conflict over basic resources likewise will accelerate.  Drought-stricken people aren't the only ones at risk.  Rapidly melting polar ice sheets already are raising sea levels, threatening the hundreds of millions of people who live in coastal cities world wide and in low-lying countries, like densely populated Bangladesh, the Netherlands, and a host of island nations.  If we dramatically slow down the human contribution to climate change, AND take the challenge seriously, we will buy time to be able to find intelligent, inclusive adaptations to living on our planet with the natural changes in its climate.	12
37	I agree wholeheartedly.  But please don't perpetuate the myth that most of humanity has always lived in extreme poverty.  It's just not true.  Anthropologists are showing that pre-civilization groups usually lived well with healthy lives and rich cultures.	13
38	Thank you once again Nicholas Kristof for taking us to a part of the world we normally don't see. This story is truly gut-wrenching. I'm glad you told us where we could offer help. I've made my donation monthly.	13

41	Thank you so much for drawing attention to the crisis in Madagascar. It is heartbreaking how much the country has to struggle with. At the same time, some of the poorest people in Madagascar are smart and resourceful. With a little support, they manage to create change. One example is this fair trade project, whose members previously scavenged from a garbage dump to survive: http://www.atd-fourthworld.org/behind-scenes-fair-trade-project-madagascar/	14
42	Mr. Kristof I am comforted by improvements in what is pejoratively referred to as the Third World, but let us not ignore the power of America to facilitate such improvements, so it is indeed worrisome on the adverse impact Trumpism will have on those US foreign aid efforts. It is also troublesome to hear about blatant acts of harassment and racism made against fellow Americans who are immigrants possessing accents.  I've heard of a radiologist technician being confronted by patients about why doesn't she go back to Mexico, or they ask for a white technician to perform their exam.  None of it is said with diplomacy, all with malice and hate propagated by the ever unthinking Donald Trump. Still, the impressive Woman's March on Washington and other cities illuminates precisely the power we collectively possess to seek and demand change, and while there will be setbacks there are the midterm elections.Ultimately, we have been here before. Think about Martin Luther King and his equally brave followers who in a little Baptist church in Atlanta, where they had no protection from police and had amongst many things, separate schools, drinking fountains; collectively they inspired many to achieve change. This legacy of suffragettes, Mexican farmworkers, and Freedom Riders guide us--let's get busy.                                                                                                                                                                                    	14
43	While any robot can understand your statement to mean, “If you can’t reliably provide food, water and shelter for yourself, don’t reproduce, at least not as much.” In choosing to be the hammer of truth, you’ve missed two far more important phenomena, as follows:1) These are skilled survivors, and they are choosing to reproduce for the traditional safety net that has provided their people. The article identifies their way of life as a casualty of climate change, so yes they’ll need to adapt or die, probably both.2) You’re message, poorly informed as it was, had a severe opportunity cost for you. Imagine what a message of compassion could have done for your day. “I am distraught and in physical pain seeing this heroic matriarch bending over under the weight of her age and responsibility. I myself have never experienced such worry.” This might have sent you (and others) into action, donating your Starbucks money, or even seeing other people as people.Also, thank you NYT for “picking” this message so as to illustrate your own capacity for human error. 	15
44	The crazy thing is that if there were a mile thick sheet of ice over one third of the U.S. and that began to melt these same people would be just as alarmed as they are now. "Save the ice sheet!" they would scream.	15

46	Whales are dying because they are migrating further North as the water in the Atlantic warms.  Canada, never having faced this problem before, are seeing them die, caught up in lobstering/fishing lines and nets.  Canada is trying to catch up to the new reality with new regulations but not fast enough.  There has not been one calf seen this year.Oh, it's changing so fast and we are doing nothing to keep up.  Republicans are still in complete denial, they won't open their eyes and just look around and see the evidence:  daffodils in December in Georgia, birds singing in winter, no food for migrating birds, bugs moving up to harm both Maine's maple trees and humans.  Ticks everywhere that weren't here before.  Life is change but this is happening so fast.	16

49	When I was younger, I was a climate change skeptic. Climate change is very real, and anyone who denies it is either ignorant or has a politically motived interest for doubting. Record lows in South American countries, coupled with sea-saw weather patterns across the United States have me convinced. We cannot change the habits of other nations, or our own apparently, but we do have the power still.

50	Articles like this are so troubling on so many levels, with even the word "dark" in the headline meant to appeal to climate change doomsayers and true believers. It's an opinion piece, so one doesn't expect to see much data presented, but even the data referenced in the link to "actual spring arriving early" brings up questions.  Spring appears to be early in Nashville, but it's late in Austin and Pensacola.  Why?  Climate scientists can't answer questions like this and they shouldn't.  Basing a "dark" recitation on anecdotes like birds singing and flowers blooming and blizzards and warm spells in any given year is just silly.Meanwhile, as one commentator has pointed out, the author drove to a lake to take a walk.  She should be compelled to tell us what kind of vehicle she drives and how big her domicile is, and whether she can hear the cardinal singing over the hum of the air conditioning unit.

51	@ Bill White,I'm a believer in technology, and the human species to use technology to combat change.   In any case warming is not necessarily bad, for example the global plant mass has increased by 25% to 50% over the last couple decades.  That is a very significant increase - plants like C02, and warmer climates.  You would do yourself a favor by not buying into half truths from the climate apocalypse prophecies.

52	Margaret Renki's article is beautifully written, but as I read it admiringly (and sadly), I wondered whether that's a part of the problem. Renki's syntax, lyricism, and pace address the kind of educated audience that needs no persuasion about climate change.We need to message differently, as the tweeter-in-chief apparently knows. I hope Ms. Renki will consider tweeting or snapchatting or instagramming on the side.	18
53	Another fine article in this week's climate series. Though it starts out with a fictional premise, it moves on to presenting facts and the discussion of generational forgetfulness is interesting. We now compare the present to a more recent past, and forget earlier norms.200 feet is an interesting figure, because in fact in the various full ice melts in distant history were a bit over 200 feet, and you can see traces of this in various locations if you look for them. 216 feet, according to this NatGeo article, which also provides illustrations: http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2013/09/rising-seas-ice-melt-...Personally, I think it will be less than two decades before the consequences will be undeniable to the most resistant intelligence. Among other things, I worry about the breakdown of the power grid. Even now, there are more weeks long power outages in extreme weather.Some of that may be more reporting, but that easy access to information also blinds us to news that is not covered, like the recent floods in Iran and Azerbaijan, and South America (one of those was reported). There have been extremes in Chile that are affecting some of our food prices, but causing a devastating water crisis for people who live and farm there.Even without government misbehavior (Venezuela, Washington DC) we will have trouble.	18

55	Will any amount of rational argument will change many more minds about the reality of climate change? But one more way to document a season’s worth of warm temperatures is to consider “heating degree days (HDD)” at various locations in the United States.  HDDs are a proxy for average temperatures: the need for heat in a given home over a heating season is directly proportional to the number of HDDs in that season. My hometown, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, is a pretty cold place. But this year, we are running 11% warmer than the 30-year “normal.” An eleven percent deviation over many months of weather is huge. And last year, we finished the heating season more than 20% warmer than normal! A challenge to those who don’t believe climate change is happening: go to the NOAA site whose link is below. Find the location in the table nearest to your home, and look at the second column from the right, which gives the cumulative percent deviation for the season (which officially begins July 1 each year.) Any negative number means it’s been warmer there this year than normal.  Find Sault Ste. Marie, MI, and you’ll see the number -11. My prediction: you’re going to see a similar number for your location. There are some exceptions, of course. But if you scan that column of over 300 locations from Alabama to Wyoming, you’ll see an overwhelming number of negative numbers. http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/cdus/degree_da...	19

58	When I was younger, I was a climate change skeptic. Climate change is very real, and anyone who denies it is either ignorant or has a politically motived interest for doubting. Record lows in South American countries, coupled with sea-saw weather patterns across the United States have me convinced. We cannot change the habits of other nations, or our own apparently, but we do have the power still. America is the largest consumer group in the world, and we need to buy reusable, compostable products, and follow through on recycling. As business grows it will become cheaper, and more efficient and accessable. My household of four produces one bag of trash in a week, pretty efficient all things considered.	20
59	Climate change is real. Its been happening continuously for the 4.5 billion years the planet earth has existed. Anthropologic Climate change (caused by humans) is not real. Modern humans have only existed for a few tens of thousands of years, and the industrial revolution is only a couple hundred years old.	20

61	You answer the easy part, but how do you feel then about the state authority having to pay for it and PP selling the parts? The Democrat position is not simply the right to abortion without justification to authority.	21
62	Glad it works. Our 40 anniversary is this month!!!  Trip to Seattle.  He's a reformed " independent ".   Cheers.	21
63	This so-called conversation demonstrates the danger in allowing Roman Catholicism to rule our moral discourse. And yet a majority of the supreme court is Roman Catholic. And when the Roman Catholic bannons join the other klukluxers, we get trump.	21
64	I do not believe abortion is a moral issue. It's a personal issue.  There's no way I will ever allow a political party to decide what a woman cannot do with her body. That's BIG GOVERNMENT in action.  I'm a 75-year-old widow and have spent my life working for women's health care.  	22
65	"No democrat that I have ever met wants voluntary abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy."You a e being disingenuous at best. Please read the official Democratic Party platform very carefully. Under Hillary, its language was changed to favor abortion throughout the full nine months.From the platform (https://www.democrats.org/party-platform#reproductive-health):"We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment." No qualifications here, and no language about abortion being "rare"; this means ALL policies, INCLUDING ANY restriction on late-term abortions. During the election all Democrats certainly understood this; how is it that you do not?	22
66	The issue is about women's rights and is not about being "the party of abortion."  In our politics we've eroded our language such that "women's rights" is heard as "pro-abortion."  And terminology like "anti-abortion" encompasses a range of regressive anxieties about women's equality and fear of women making their own decisions.A woman has a right to make choices about her health including reproductive health.  As a Catholic, she will exercise that right in light of her religious teachings.  No one - especially the State - may interfere in her right to choose against an abortion.  The underlying principle is that she has a constitutional right to exercise choices about her own health including pregnancy. Without that right, a woman is less than a full citizen without a right to free will.  The most meaningful action in questions of morality or principle is that taken as a result of free will.  As a right, women exercise their conscience freely without interference of distant legislators.   I can exercise that choice in light of my own moral underpinning, my religious tradition, the advice of a health provider, and in consultation with loved ones if I choose to include them.  The "anti-abortion" movement is about disturbing the rights women have as functional citizens.  This is not a statement in favor of abortion; far from it.  Rather, it concerns a woman's right to make her own decisions without interference from the State. A political party should stand for something.  	22
67	Amen, Mr. Groome.I recall that President Clinton said that we should work to make abortion safe and rare.Never vote for a candidate on one issue.  Most frequently, the vote will backfire.  Mayor Bloomberg said at the Democratic National Convention, on nationwide TV, (paraphrasing here), Hillary Clinton is not a perfect candidate, there is no such thing as a perfect candidate.  I'm voting for Hillary Clinton because she is "sane and competent".  Does that resonate?The Gospels are full of examples of Democratic-held principles.  Read those and Pope Francis' words of humility, generosity of spirit, and peace.  I don't see a lot of those characteristics in the Republicans of today.  They've gone way off course.	23
68	Access to comprehensive women's health care, including access to a safe and legal abortion, is proven to reduce the instances of abortion, improve the availability of a range of necessary health care, and importantly allows individuals to make deeply personal decisions consistent with their personal beliefs.   This does not force Professor Groome or anyone else to do anything inconsistent with their own personal beliefs and does not intrude on their individual rights.  Fortunately, so many people support  parties and candidates who support civil rights and access to safe and comprehensive health care.  I am ever thankful for and appreciative of those politicians, including the many in the Democratic party and the few in the GOP (I hope their numbers grow) who exercise leadership by clearly and strongly standing up for individual rights and the rights of our daughters to make personal decisions about their lives and bodies.    	23
69	Awww...c'mon.  The title gives the whole thing away:  Democrats are the "Abortion Party". Silly me!  I thought the Dems were the party of choice.It's so confusing these days!  The Republicans (party of freedom, they say) seem not to want reproductive choice.  And from what I gather, life ends at birth in that version of things as well.  That *always* trips me up....makes it so difficult for me to remember that they're the pro-life ones.My forebears (Mennonites) split off from the Catholic church about five hundred years ago because "to begin with they publicly acknowledged that (*choice*) is an issue of profound moral and religious concern."I'm sure they also understood abortion to be an issue of profound moral and religious concern, but at least in their theology choice came first.That never sat well with the Catholic church.  We had to leave Switzerland and head to the Ukraine to stay alive.  I guess that made us a sort of pro-life party.  But, then again, we did all that migrating *after* being born, so maybe it doesn't count.Eventually we made to America.  Prospects seemed better here...at least at that time they did.  We were immigrants.  Spoke mostly German.  Dressed oddly.  Did a lot of work on the cheap because we had to.  Prospered modestly.  Didn't cause much trouble, statistically speaking.All of that brings me to today where I can read the Times and learn that now I'm in the "party of Abortion".	23

71	This decision is absolutely staggering in it's INTENDED consequences. This is what happens when "deeply held religious beliefs" supersede common sense. You don't need multiple studies to predict the outcome of this deplorable ruling - HUMAN BEINGS will suffer and die in the name of a God who (if he even exists) is weeping at what we are doing to each other.Whatever happened to the FIRST amendment? Do we live in a theocracy, with "Christian Sharia Law?"Women will NOT be dragged back to the Middle Ages!There is a massive movement to defund Planned Parenthood. On 2/11 there will be demonstrations outside PP clinics. http://protestpp.com/locations/ A friend of mine has pledged to donate $1 to PP for every PRO-ABORTION protester that shows up at our local clinic. I am far from wealthy but I will do the same. How about you? How much will you pledge? 	24
72	Not possible. Abortion rights are in the Democratic   parties DNA. The Republicans moderates won't   speak their  conscious  on abortion either. You see them struggling with health care  with the right wing cries of impurity. They would be ejected from the party. Democrats speaking against abortion is equally impossible. The left wouldn't  allow it.The elite that controls the Democrats  have a problem dividing people into smaller and smaller groups and then exploiting them. Old Irish Catholics were part of the demographics  fifty  years ago. But if they could find morally conservative Democrats to run in the darkest red of diistricts I think they will find out it isn't just about religion. The pander and exploit theory of both parties has failed. Even though one side or the other wins it's about the rich getting richer. 	24

74	After the Forced-Birth debacle in Texas, anti-abortionists are now facing that reality. Ugly in its inhumanity, divorced from ethics and reason, the anti-abortion Republicans kicked American women in the teeth one time too many. Now, women nationwide, Republicans included, are going to reclaim their Constitutional rights of equal treatment under the law.	25

76	GOP= party of forced pregnancy.	26
77	I'm 64 &amp; have always been pro-choice, remembering the bad old days. However, a five-month fetus is not a clump of cells anymore or an alien looking creature. I feel so sorry for rape &amp; incest victims. But in my opinion, the only exceptions should be for the life of the mother or because the fetus is so genetically impaired, it would suffer more from being born. 	26
78	Pro-life people should support the research for developing fetus outside the human body and then fight for the fund that will support all these unwanted children until adulthood.	26
79	One more reason for women to turn out in record numbers to vote in this midterm election.  At 65, I'm no longer concerned about pregnancy for myself, but women of all ages must stand together on this issue.  Men cannot do this to us.  And it is men .Donald Trump - of all men - and Mitch McConnell - my god - do not have the right to tell me how to live my life, or what to do with my body.  I am free and over 21.  I will do exactly as I desire.  If men got pregnant it would be legal, and free, and available on demand.You may be able to impregnate her, but you cannot force a woman to be pregnant, and give birth.  That is an unspeakable thing to do to a woman. Only a man would do such a thing to a woman.	27

81	I used to be passionately actively involved in abortion rights politics but not anymore.  If women themselves can't be bothered to go out and vote for politicians who will protect their right to choose, I've moved on to other priorities too.	27
82	Easy way to solve the abortion issue. Women assume 100% financial and legal responsibility for their children. If a father wants custody or joint custody if living with the mother she can grant it and and can even ask for support. But no more of this heads I win tails you loss nonsense of the woman unilaterally killing the baby without the father or society's input BUT after babies are born demanding support from the father / society.  If a baby has two parents when it comes time to pay for food and diapers than a baby has two parents when one of them wants to kill the baby. 	28
83	If infanticide is immoral and abortion is moral, what criteria should we use to differentiate which is which?  Viability seems like an appropriate compromise.  If not 20 weeks, maybe 24 weeks.  I am not sure of the exact cutoff, but society is becoming more aware that the baby in the womb has some rights as well, which is a good thing.	28

86	The fetus died in utero and then went septic. The Irish doctors refused to take the dead fetus. The young woman died, as you point out, while they were arguing about it.Her death is the basis of the upheaval in Irish reproductive laws.How I regret the loss of her.	29
87	Someone we know and love wanted a baby desperately and she and her husband used fertility services to achieve a pregnancy. They were ecstatic, until the 20-week ultrasound--which showed an "anacephalic" baby, with no functioning brain tissue. (This is far more severe than the "microcephalic" babies possible after a mother's Zika infection.) This baby might survive until birth but could not live more than an hour outside the womb. The couple maintained the pregnancy, hoping for a miracle, and the mother underwent a C-section to make it easier for the baby. The baby died about 40 minutes after birth, since the brain was insufficient to maintain breathing or a heartbeat. The mother suffered deep depression after the birth.That was their decision, one they made with care, and they did have an abortion option. But other parents, getting news like this after the 20 week abortion cutoff in many states, would have no choice in the matter. 	29
89	Pro-choice is the only rational approach to abortion. It allows the hyper-religious fundamentalists of each religious practice to deny females their independence from males. They can choose to carry their pregnancy to term. Those who value womens independent agency in life allow women to consult with their doctors, their clergy, their family and friends, therapists and themselves so they can decide whether or not they want to carry their pregnancy to term.	30
90	The first issue is whether "our bodies are our own."  The answer to that is clear: as members of civilized society, our bodies are NOT our own to do with as we please.  For example, all males in the United States must register for the draft on the day after their eighteenth birthday, and historically millions have actually been drafted, sent to war and into combat ... almost all against their will.  So personal sovereignty over our bodies is at best limited.The second issue is, what do other civilized countries do?  The information I've found shows that other civilized nations generally allow legal abortions prior to viability.  Sweden, for example, allows abortion on demand up to 18 weeks, and with permission of a national health board, up to 22 weeks:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Sweden#CurrentIf everybody in society has an interest in the welfare of everybody else in society, then society has an interest in the reproductive process.  The question is, how intrusive is that right in a civilized society?  It seems to me that Sweden has answered that question pretty well.	30

97	Fewer people will vote for Biden than vote for Trump. More people, a lot more, will vote against Trump than vote against Biden. They are the two most unfavorable politicians in the country and both parties seem destined to nominate them both. Unfortunately, the Dems are generally more crafty and Machiavellian so they will likely pull the rug out from under Biden sometime early next year and run a better candidate while Reps will be holding the bag with Trump.	33

99	Maybe its just me. But how on earth can that even be a conversation. There is no way that Biden could win anything. The polls show its tied. MY ASS , 85% Trump 15% Biden in a real poll. IN a none fraud election 90% to 10%	33
100	I love Trump. People voted for Biden because they were taught to hate Trump. Hate and spite are not good reasons for a great country to vote for a president!	34
101	The senile, incompetent, corrupt guy installed in the WH is the face of the Democrat Party. Biden represents them heart and soul.	34
102	Something about these polls looks off. I remember in 2016 they said there were people who where "shy" about saying they were voting for Trump. - Im thinking that may be gone now. But is it possible that people could be shy saying theyd support Biden out of embarrassment ?	34
103	As an ex-Delaware Democrat, I never voted for Joe Biden.  He is not smart and he cannot control what comes out of his mouth.  When Obama picked him for VP because of his so called foreign experience that Obama himself lacked, it was a huge red flag to me that Obama was clueless. That Biden went along with disgusting Senator Specter in the Anita Hill incident is real testimony to his character. That Biden lowered himself to Trump's level to engage in such absurd tweeting shows how puerile his mentality is. I never would want to see Biden active in politics again.  And by the way both Obama and Biden have been curiously silent about the chaos Trump has put this country in.  For that I can never forgive either of them.  Please leave huffy blue collar Biden in the high school football stadium of teenage bluster.	35

105	It's a free country; whoever wants to run for President can run for President, as we were recently, painfully reminded.Joe Biden's a good guy, but it's time to pass the Democratic baton to the non-retirement community.Bill Clinton and Barack Obama vaulted out of relative obscurity to win the Presidency cleanly without Electoral College assistance, unlike the last two Greed Over People Catastrophes-In-Chief who both weaseled their way into office through Republican rigging and rampant voter suppression.Democrats are superior on the issues; they just learn to message.And by the time 2020 comes around, Daycare Donnie - if for some strange reason he is still in office and not enjoying a prison cell - will have sufficiently soiled his playpen so that once again Americans will be clamoring for yet another Democrat to step up and clean up all of the right-wing excrement and carnage left by yet another calamitous, disastrous, right-wing, Republican administration.The more pressing matter in 2018 is registering disenfranchised citizens to vote and voting in a new Congress to defuse the time-bomb that is the David Dennison Administration.Donate $5 to a voter registration organization to help overthrow the right-wing coup d'etat:https://www.rockthevote.org/donate/https://www.voterparticipation.org/support-our-work/donate-to-vpc/https://www.eac.gov/voters/resourcesforvoters/Voting in record numbers is the only way out.And your life and your democracy depend on it.	35

109	HILLARY WON THE POPULAR VOTE DUMMIES  People who pontificate about why a woman lost show their ignorance, which does little to support their position.  I will say that Nikki Haley seems one of the most articulate, self-assured, intelligent and pragmatic of Trump's Cabinet of Horrors.  Though I deride her union busting--high heels or flip flops.  Now with concrete evidence of collusion between the Trump team and the Russians, the number of people leaving top office to go to jail will dwarf the number convicted during Watergate.  To the extent that it may trigger a Constitutional crisis, requiring an emergency election for President and other  top officers.  About Sarah Palin--I'm still waiting for her to finish a sentence.  I hear she's opened a chain of restaurants with health food called Sarah's Word Salad Bar.  Featuring all you can blab!	37
110	If she’s not confident that she can win then she should get out right now and support the party’s candidate.	37
111	Who’s strong enough to be Trump’s VP and to clean house other than Ron or Vivek? Maybe Youngkin. Sorry but as a woman I don’t see any woman I like as a VP choice.	37
112	Well, as you say they wouldnt have been chosen in the first place if they were leaders. Thats why Biden was perfect. With nothing but warm diarrhea between his ears he was unlikely to ever question his orders from China and Old Europe.	38
113	Im the biggest Trump supporter out there and I LIKE having Nervous Nikki in there..it gives us a punching bag not named Joe Biden..we dont want him somehow becoming a martyr..therell be plenty of time to beat joe into the ground after Super Tuesday..plus winning races by 45 or 55 points is pretty fun	38
114	democrats are desperate. a.b. stoddard is championing a losing ticket. whitmer is not popular outside of Michigan and neither is warnock who also has no name recognition outside of Georgia. Neither one has any chance of winning.	38
115	Those donors are starting to spend money down ballot now hoping to keep as many seats as possible because they know this election is going to be very ugly for Republicans when there will be a convicted felon at the top of the ticket.	39

117	Nikki says she is “doing it” for the troops. According to an affidavit, she was “doing it” with a dude while her soldier hubby was serving overseas. The guy’s ex wife apparently cited Nikki’s affair with her hubby in the divorce filing. Nikki then says she believes Jean Carroll’s accusations against Trump. Maybe the voters believe Nikki cheated on her hubby and believe that Trump was falsely accused? Just saying…	39
118	I appreciate these challengers going up against Trump, my FL governor amongst them. But it is now time to rally in unison for our former and next President, DJT.	40
119	Awwww....those poor people. So, I guess now we're supposed to sympathize with them now that they are getting what they voted for. They voted for the host of a reality show. They actually thought a man who has never even met a poor person was going to suddenly be their savior. The host of a reality show LOL!!! They ruined the country for the rest of us....now they have to suffer the consequences along with the rest of us.  They can go work in a coal mine....those are the jobs they wanted to save, so have at it. 	40
120	First I thought,” good”, this serves them right...voting for this charlatan. Then I stopped, remembering the words of A Spiritual Master who proclaims that to unseat this man, one will have to break the mental constructs that his supporters have created around his cult of personality. If this is the initiation of that, well, isn’t that just fine.	40
121	And theyre BRAGGING about this?	41
122	It is always the same with the left, it is never their fault. It is always something else.	41
123	I think a similar process will need to be applied towards California, Oregon, Washington and New York, i.e. these different states will need to be force cleansed of socialism.	41
124	Except NOAA's actual data disagrees and NOAA states: " ... average global sea level rise rate of 1.7-1.8 mm/yr."

125	The preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives, because one can always burden failing explanations with ad hoc pseudo-scientific nonsense to prevent a failing explanation from being falsified; therefore, simpler explanations are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable. “Simpler” means the explanation that contains the fewer causal principles.	42
126	Thats really not the point. The climate is warming. Why, frankly, is irrelevant. What matters is that we need to make adjustments, not ignore it. We dont cause earthquakes, but we build structures to survive them. Its the same principle.	42
127	News Flash, Billy. We are all going to die - whether or not climate change occurs. So what every man should do - is repent of our arrogance and pride and idol worship of climate change. Thank God for the wondrous blessing of this earth, our environment and for the amazing CO2-Oxygen cycle that He has created. The more C02 that we create, the more grass, trees and plants grow.	43
128	Another fine article in this week's climate series. Though it starts out with a fictional premise, it moves on to presenting facts and the discussion of generational forgetfulness is interesting. We now compare the present to a more recent past, and forget earlier norms.200 feet is an interesting figure, because in fact in the various full ice melts in distant history were a bit over 200 feet, and you can see traces of this in various locations if you look for them. 216 feet, according to this NatGeo article, which also provides illustrations: http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2013/09/rising-seas-ice-melt-...Personally, I think it will be less than two decades before the consequences will be undeniable to the most resistant intelligence. Among other things, I worry about the breakdown of the power grid. Even now, there are more weeks long power outages in extreme weather.Some of that may be more reporting, but that easy access to information also blinds us to news that is not covered, like the recent floods in Iran and Azerbaijan, and South America (one of those was reported). There have been extremes in Chile that are affecting some of our food prices, but causing a devastating water crisis for people who live and farm there.Even without government misbehavior (Venezuela, Washington DC) we will have trouble.	43

132	Climate change is real. Its been happening continuously for the 4.5 billion years the planet earth has existed. Anthropologic Climate change (caused by humans) is not real. Modern humans have only existed for a few tens of thousands of years, and the industrial revolution is only a couple hundred years old.	44
133	You conveniently ignore the scale of CO2 in the atmosphere and mans contribution. Please see my other comment. CO2 is NOT the cause, it is a lagging indicator. During the industrial revolution we polluted the world with enourmous amounts of large particle emmissions. This actually caused the earth to cool. Since the clean air acts all over the industrail world from the late 50s the. temperature begin to show a marked rise and has now returned to its natural trend. This was the pause that the climate alarmists could not explain but were forced to accept and have now forgotten and ignore in their shrill panic to get the population to believe in something that has never been proved. In fact what has been proved time and time again is that ALL their predictions (based on the faulty climate models) have been proved false.	45
134	AGW believers' suggestion that there's a real danger is based on their false assumption that they know a lot about the situation. And some people blindly trust those scientists because they are successful in their propaganda, not because of the scientific facts. And using their fictional narrative they try to change the lives of the whole earth's population. It's really scary - having no proof, not knowing what's going on, putting as a evidence not even a guess but just a desired explanation for their action - they want to start some imagined fight affecting existence of billions of people. They are not prudent.  Prudent is the real science and not shouting down your opponents. Immeasurably Irresponsible and dangerous - that's what those "believers" are.Those scientists cannot predict what will happen in 5-10 years. They don't know the nature's secrets and have no idea how the nature works. But they insist that their incomplete and totally unreliable models can tell what will happen in a hundred years. It's not just an arrogance, it's a fraud.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/science/global-warming-climate-change-...http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20140916-the-corals-that-come-back-from-t...http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/science/coral-reef-climate-change.html...	45
135	Al Gore is not a source of scientific insight.  But hey, do you know that sometimes warnings are heeded in time?  You mention a few of those, but seem to think they were nothing.The destruction of the ozone layer was, luckily, discovered in time and, luckily, there was no significant obstructionism funded by affected industries to avert international agreement to do away with CFCs in the Montreal Protocol.  If this was not done, we'd face an increase of UV at the surface that would, besides skin cancer and eye damage for everybody, also harm or kill land animals and lead to damage and increased mutations in plants. We lucked out on that one.Y2K was a dangerous situation which didn't result in catastrophe for two reasons: 1) not as much of the worlds infrastructure was computerized 17 years ago and 2) people addressed the risk in time.A very large number of people were diverted from normal tasks and instead spent a great deal of time reviewing code, modifying or replacing code as needed, and testing solutions. It was expensive. It slowed businesses from implementing other systems that would have contributed to business growth.  That New Year's Eve had probably the largest number of data center staff in their offices than any other - until the Y10K problem comes up.	45

137	There fixed the headline for ya.	46
138	Lancet at its best was always a kinda, sorta sciency magazine. Now, it offers nothing.	46
139	Climate change has always been a part of Earth's history.  Our planet has been much colder than it is now, but it has also been much warmer.  This is indicated by the fossil record.  Currently, we are coming out of the last ice age.  Are we accelerating this natural change?  Is it because of burning fossil fuels?    Mass extinctions have happened on our planet several times and that may be in our future.  No humans were on Earth during the past mass extinctions.   Check this out:  www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events Some scientists believe rises in carbon dioxide may have naturally occurred in the past, contributing to these mass extinctions.  There are many things we can do to improve the environment but concern about climate change might not be something we can avoid.   If it is natural, as many scientists believe, we must put our efforts into engineering ways to grow food in warmer temperatures, etc.    Preparing for the inevitable is better than blaming a natural process on carbon dioxide emissions. I received one of the books mentioned.  I have perused it casually.  So far, I have not read anything I did not already know.  There are many things we can do to improve environmental quality.Our budget is limited. That is why we have to really push to educate the public about what is natural and what is not. What can we do for the environment and what is out of our control? 	47
140	Sounds like an outfit called the Discovery Center (based in the northwest) a few years ago. They were touting a document they claimed was signed by 400 scientists basically saying that global warming (the phrase then) was nonsense. I took the list of scientists and googled any number of the ones listed with a PhD. Not one of them came up on the web other than in connection with this center and its document. PhDs I know personally have a rich and extensive online presence with academic work, papers published, conferences in which they presented papers etc.  Clearly these "scientists" were either did not exist at all (I have no PhD, but a pretty clear presence on a google search) or are not who they were claimed to be. 	47
141	It’s insane to think that glaciers will never melt and the climate won’t continue to change and that man caused it. I doubt the dinosaurs wanted the earth to cool but they didn’t drive cars, burn fossil fuels etc. it’s just the nature of the world and life. Their whole obsession with CO2 is nonsense too. Volcano’s, forest fires all produce more pollution daily the world over than man has any part of. IT’S ALL ABOUT THEM HAVING OUR MONEY AND MORE POWER	47
142	Whatever the author is moaning about is not as bad as natural climate change that has occurred in the past.  Read this article about the "little ice age" for some perspective.  We are spoiled to have lived in a golden age.http://www.history.com/news/little-ice-age-big-consequences	48
143	Since carbon dioxide levels have risen in the atmosphere, we have seen greening in previously arid regions like the Sahel and South West India. This is because higher levels of CO2 make plants more drought resistant. So its not just greenhouses; the entire Earth benefits fro higher CO2.	48
144	I accept that the climate is gradually warming, even though the hockey-stick spike that has been frightening everyone for the past two decades does not seem to be panning out.  But several issues espoused by global warming devotees greatly disturb me.  First, the expensive "solutions" mandated in the Paris Accord, by self-admission, have no material impact on warming, yet will cost us $78 trillion by the year 2100.  Why should we pay for solutions that do not work? Second, artificially raising the cost of energy will tend to propagate poverty.  No one seems to be analyzing which is worse - rising temperatures or rising poverty. Third, no one mentions that global warming is not all bad.  Higher temperatures will vastly improve the habitability and arability of the Northern Hemisphere land masses.  Will this gain in economically viable land offset the loss of coastline? And since rich people own virtually all of the world's coastline, why would I want to pay higher energy prices in order to save Mar-a-Lago?	48

146	In other words, sure climate change will be catastrophic for hundreds of millions of mostly poor people, but the real problem is that many who want to take strong action are godforsaken, big government liberals. Great priorities you got there. Besides, nobody says taxes and regs will "reverse the trend." It's already way too late for that. But aggressive, global government action may help flatten the curve. BTW, what's your alternative?	49
147	It's not just among schoolteachers that books like these sow doubt.  They do so for the public as well.  There is an assumption made, which is correct, that the American public is quite ignorant on how science works, how it proves hypotheses, tests to disprove them, what controls are, and why a scientist never says that any event or theory is 100% true.  The reason Americans are so easy to lie to is because they assume, wrongly, that science is too difficult to comprehend.  On a basic level it's not.  If our schools did a better job teaching science in grades K-12, and our colleges performed likewise, we'd have a more science literate public which could then see some of these "experts" for what they are.  There is another point to be made here as well.  Just because some politicians and their supporters don't want to acknowledge climate change doesn't mean that steps should not be taken to mitigate the effects of eroding coastlines, shifting breadbaskets in countries, droughts, etc.  Funding efforts like this provides jobs, draws on human ingenuity to solve the problem(s), and may even prevent a few wars.	49
148	I'm writing this comment when only 5 comments are showing.  The prevailing attitude is negative and defeated.  We who understand climate change must force ourselves to understand a couple other things: first, unless and until we can bring a significant number of Republicans into the effort, we will pass no legislation to fix it.  Second, we do not need all of them; just enough to join with Democrats who are already on board.  The statistics on voter attitudes in the article are true.  Already there is a bi-partisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House.  In 2015 there was the Gibson Resolution, a group of Republicans acknowledging our moral responsibility to act on climate.  We, especially those of us with Republican representatives, should be calling those reps to praise this Republican ice breaker crashing into the party's blockade.  These leaders have a meeting scheduled today in the White House with Pence, Ivanka, and a bunch of economic advisors.  Remember how rapidly things changed on gay issues.  This policy can be huge, and we must encourage and reinforce it to Reps, senators, and our local newspapers.	50
149	You have nonsense from right wing media. If you want to know whats happening to the climate, talk to climatologists. To a one, theyll explain that the earth is warming due to our burning of fossil fuels.	50
150	Thanks for this effort by the small tribe of remaining rational Republicans, and your ideas have merit in a rational world. Climate change is already quite disruptive- and extremely dangerous. James Hansen, one of the world's greatest climate scientists (and a Republican) has long made similar proposals. They make sense on almost every level, except one: The Republican Party is a subsidiary of the fossil fuel companies, especially Koch and Exxon, and has opposed carbon taxes just as fiercely as the Clean Power Plan for at least a decade.  I applaud the efforts of the authors of this OpEd, but their Party has been hijacked by a sector that is only 2.5% of our economy. Its power derives from desperation, and historical willingness to engage in nefarious (as in bribing our politicians) strategies to keep the oil flowing.I recently hosted a private event on Nob Hill in San Francisco during AGU in December. The ideas that came out of that are both more disruptive and, in the current environment, more practical. Gangster capitalism, embraced by our fossil fuel sector, cannot be gently overcome. It can only be fought and defeated (though some attendees had other views):https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_t-6ku13PGmx-V6kbCFkZCg3TSw9nCJ5Queries about the strategies presented- each guest was limited to five minutes- can be addressed to me at mike.greenframe@gmail.com	50

154	The bible is very clear on when life begins.  In Genesis 2, the first human is first made and shaped by his creator.  Nothing is missing because only one thing needs to be added -- the breath of life, which comes directly from YHWH (the Lord God) into Adam's nostrils and only then does Adam become a living being.Life as portrayed in Genesis begins when the spirit of God enters the body, allowing the human to breathe unassisted.The issue of life beginning at the time of conception needs to be removed from the debate.  There is not only no biblical support for that position, there is also biblical evidence to the contrary.	52
155	I support every woman's right to make her own personal decision - what I don't support is the anti-abortion stance that their way is the only option.  If you want to counsel your friends, relatives, neighbors on options  - I am all for it.  Why are they denying the pro choice supporters the same position?  	52
156	This is really interesting, but I wish Ana Marie, who's a great interviewer, had asked about contraceptives.  Pregnancy is not cancer; we know how to prevent it. Why not put your energy toward making sure that's provided and thus restore to women control over their bodies while also not "ending a life" as this guy puts it?	52
157	He certainly does not discuss right and wrong. That is a very simplistic vioew of what he states. I also appreciate his candor. I am from the opposite view, but find it refreshing to have an honest doctor explain his decision not to preserve license but to end it. He posits, that it is in a way murder, ie cessation of a process. that would otherwise result in life.  However, he explains that it is tolerable (not right) as a balance between the life of the woman and the fetal life.Many fall the other way in this balancing.He states: " I value them both, but in the precedence of things, when a woman comes to me, I find myself unable to demote her aspirations because of the aspirations that someone else has for the fetus that she’s carrying."I don't agree, but I respect his opinion. 	53
158	It was so refreshing to read someone say that the life of a woman has value and should take precedence over a pregnancy. Woman are people.	53
159	They are not pro-life. They are pro-fetus and pro-birth...and then y'all are on your own. Pro-hypocrisy.	53
160	"Pro life" is a misnomer and should be denounced as such by society. "Pro lifers" are "for" the life in the very short term of an embryo which may become a fetus and then a baby. But they are against the life of that baby who, if it survives a horrible childhood as an unwanted child, becomes a poor, disenfranchised drain on public funds.They are also against the life of the unwilling mother, whose health and happiness are apparently irrelevant, and whose subsequent draining of public coffers as a (usually) single mother hurts every American's life.If the life of a fetus/baby in the very short run is worth more that all of the above, how exactly are "pro lifers" pro life?	54
161	I find interesting your words "when life becomes human" and "life is a process."  Would you mind if i asked just two questions?1.  Is a zygote a single living thing i.e an organism?2. Can organisms of a certain species exist at one time as members of that same species and, at another time, members of a different species?Any biologist (or Google) will answer 'no' to both of these questions.  Life may be, in some sense, a process from one stage to the next, but it is always the process of one organism through those stages.  If one agrees with the principles of biology, she/he must agree that the fetus is a human.  A fetal human, similar to an adult human, an infant human,  a juvenile human, you get the picture.When a "baby comes into being." Again, does a living baby come into being from some separate organism or does an organism that is in the fetal stage of life progress into infancy while still remaining the same single organism?	54
162	And another thing:  "Right to 'Life'" is a religious movement founded and driven by the Catholic Church and certainly with plenty of aid from evangelicals, and touted from their pulpits.That's political speech and it's about time they stopped getting away with it.  We need Democratic lawmakers to have the courage NOW to introduce bills eliminating non-profit status for religious institutions.  If they want to sway society's laws then they can darn well start paying their fair freight as members of society.   Property taxes, income taxes, FICA taxes for their employees -- the full freight.The notion that these selfish cults are trying to rob us of our rights and doing so on our dime to boot is beyond galling.  	54
163	That does not mean it’s life before it can live. That passage doesn’t even say that. It says human beings develop in the womb, but it’s not a human being until it can live.	55
164	The phrase "human entity" captures well the Biblical sense of the unborn, as well as the newly born. For example, in Leviticus chapter 27 the Lord sets out the different monetary values he places on human beings for ritual purposes. He assigns varying values to all people EXCEPT for those less than a month old and the unborn; they have zero value. So, sure, human life begins at conception, but that is NOT the same thing as saying that fully-valued human life begins at conception. The Bible does not teach anywhere the equivalence of the unborn with adults.	55
165	I agree that we all came from the same place in the same way, and should be able choose without interference. I'm curious why you don't think this extends to those at the first step in our common journey.Dr. Parker seems to agree with you, and performs some mental jujitsu, differentiating between "human" and "person". That may help him sleep at night but it begs the question:  when does the fetus become a "person"? Is it "viability"? Then how do you define that? Infants can survive when born at 22 week, due to medical advances, but this hasn’t always been the case. Does this imply that technology bestows personhood? Is it "birth"? If so, what's different between a child the day before birth vs the day after birth? Is personhood is based on location? Is it simply the mother's decision? How do you square that with your assertion that we have the right make our own life choices? And why would her right to bestow personhood end upon birth?If not any of these, then how is "personhood" bestowed? As for religion and dogma, you have it backwards. Dogma does not determine truth, but rather truth determines dogma. I can only speak from a Catholic perspective, for which dogma is backed up with logic and reason, and is not just an assertion of "because I said so".	55

169	There are various forms of killing a living thing. Its called the concept of "moral standing." Thats why we distinguish between first, second, third degree homicide, manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, etc. The same goes for the issue of abortion. There are degrees of moral standing that a fetus has. For instance, the older it is, it has more moral standing, prima facie. However, other mitigating circumstances come into play: the age or health of the mother; the conditions under which she became pregnant; the health of the fetus itself. It is not a black and white matter, except for extremists.	57
170	sorry but I will always be for abortion no matter what you and others say....my body my choice. keep your hands off my body....abortion on demand	57
171	No, murder is a legal term that doesnt apply to abortion. Shed just be killing it, and its her right.	57
172	Most citizens dont want to flee their states. They want to be able to obtain critical medical care where they live. But I care more about how this case will help democrats nationally in the 2024 elections. And believe me, it is going to help a lot! I rarely have anything to thank Texas about, but I thank them for how they treated this woman.	58
173	That could be the result. However, I would rather be on the right side of protecting life in the womb than politics. Maybe you cant win an election that way but then there is something better coming for those who make the right choices.	58
174	A woman who has a family who wanted this child is carrying a non viable fetus. It will jeopardize her ability to have children going forward and does jeopardize her life. In no way do these laws justify the treatment Kate Cox is getting, as is thousands of other women across the country. These occurrences are not rare in pregnancy. They occur significantly more than you think. There is no justification to killing a young woman just so your ideology is supported.	58
175	This documentary demonstrates how many thousands of women are being affected negatively with their fertility and their lives due to these arcane abortion laws in Red states across the country. These politicians making these laws have no idea what they are doing to families lives. It isnt just the women. It is also the men who are affected.	59
176	It is a state issue now, but I do agree with her that the abortion law should make an exception for a pregnancy that isnt viable. There is no way you should ask a woman to carry a baby all the way to birth and then have to watch it die when they know that is going to happen. Some birth defects are just that way -- the baby will live in the womb but cant survive outside it. If they determine that is the case, then abortion needs to be legal for it.	59

179	All of Western Europe has laws that make abortion illegal at 20 weeks - except when the mother's life is at risk, and there is little if any political force in Europe to expand legal abortion to 20 weeks. Where are the claims of misogyny by the left in the US against the thousands of women politicians of Europe?Reasonable people understand that abortion is not simply about women's rights, but also countries deciding when does a human life get protection from government against being killed.	60
180	Two very important points Parker makes:"I find myself unable to demote her aspirations because of the aspirations that someone else has for the fetus that she’s carrying.""When women acquiesce to a role determined primarily by their biology of reproduction — even if it’s unconsciously — they judge each other for rejecting that primary identity."It's the willingness of anti-abortion activists to distill down a woman's existence merely to her capacity to procreate rather than on her capacity to assess her situation and determine if she wants to become a parent or not that always confounds me. It's not just the judgment aspect that is so troubling and intractable but the dismissing, slicing away all the other parts of a woman's existence, the woman's capacity to know herself, her situation, and her own aspirations, all in the name of preserving life. A Facebook friend said she was not judging women but only interested in preserving life. Baloney. It's judgment. The way anti-abortionists see it, any woman who has sex within or outside marriage without the want to become a parent is committing a sin.  What they are doing is stripping women who become pregnant of every aspect of her existence except her womb. Read "Defenders of the Unborn" about how women during the depression were dying at alarming rates due to self-abortions and how this changed physicians' attitudes toward providing abortions. Is this what it has to come to again in the US?	60

1	We are fighting for control of intelligence in our country right now--the answer is fight, fight, fight, resist.<br/><br/>No compromise--this is seen as weakness from these bozos.  Trump spoke last night about Black History Month with two of “his” African-Americans at his side (Does he see them as slaves?) Ben Carson and Omarosa.<br/><br/>He spoke of Douglass as if he were still alive--but DEFINITELY had never heard of the man as he read from a paper in front of him.<br/><br/>Devos is easily the most ignorant, unqualified person in his cabinet--next to Carson, Governor Good Hair (Nuclear energy?), and Senator Perdue (agricultural--the guy started Dollar General stores!)<br/><br/>Higher education, being articulate, and reading real books is now considered so wrong, so ELITIST.  We must take our country back from this lot of racist, xenophobic, cruel STUPID sub-humans.<br/><br/>I’m sick of being the nice party, the empathetic party, the roll over party--that’s you Chuck Schumer and Pelosi!)<br/><br/>I sat in jail for protesting the Vietnam War. Time to get our from behind the computer screens.  Twitter attacks don’t equal heading to the airports, to the WH, to Fortress Trump on Fifth Avenue, and Mar-A-Lago (where Uday and Qusay doubled the entry fee to $200,000--Emoluments Clause?)<br/><br/>Gather on Fifth Avenue--say you’re trying to get to St. Patrick’s or trying to find food at Trump Grill (the BEST taco salad!).<br/><br/>But go protest--today!	[Trump Donald J, Supreme Court (US), Pence Mike, Gorsuch Neil M, United States Politics and Government]	Pence’s Presidential Pet	NyTimes
2	Trump will go down as the WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. I know when someone makes a statement like that they need supportive evidence to backup their opinion. My evidence appears on a daily, hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute, second-by-second news accounts about Trump and the swamp mates he brought with him. Historians will be in demand to offer "we the people" how Trump is destroying this once great nation.	[Trump Donald J, Curiel Gonzalo P, United States Politics and Government, Decisions and Verdicts, Courts and the Judiciary, Mexico, Border Barriers]	Mr. Trump and the ‘Very Bad Judge’	NyTimes
3	This is at the root, too, of why over a decade ago the Pentagon started labeling climate change as the number one threat to our national security. With impoverished populations will come massive migrations, unsettled and angry populaces, and eventual pandemics.<br/><br/>Thank you for presenting us with some of the human faces on the front lines of human caused suffering.	[El Nino Southern Oscillation, Drought, Global Warming, Malnutrition, Catholic Relief Services, Madagascar, Foreign Aid, Climate Change]	As Trump Denies Climate Change, These Kids Die	NyTimes
4	Yes, climate change is real, Ms Renkl. I would never deny it. Driving in your car for a pleasant walk around a lake--instead of, say, riding your bike there--is not going to help the situation, however. Nor will you convert anyone who doesn't believe in climate change by dropping snide, smug comments about their fearless leader. <br/><br/>As my mamaw used to say, you'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. I'd have thought someone from Tennessee would have known that already. This column is a master exercise in rhetoric that speaks only to the NYTimes clickbait choir. It appears I again need to lower my expectations of its editorial board's standards.

5	We have all heard the joke (only too true) that Republicans believe that life begins at conception and ends at birth.  I remain flummoxed by the Democratic Party's inability to rightfully seize the issue of "life" away from Republicans, including the so-called Christian Right.  Democrats need to make it clear that abortion is rarely a "good" or "right" course of action.  The issue of abortion is a gut-wrenching, heart-breaking decision for anybody to face.  No Democratic candidate should ever believe he or she has to defend abortion.  It is no more a moral "good" than divorce.  The constitutional issue is always the right of women to decide a deeply personal and potentially religious issue for themselves.  The Republicans have made themselves the Party of executions, trigger-happy policing and war.  The only "life" whose rights they support is their own.	[Abortion, United States Politics and Government, Birth Control and Family Planning, Clinton Hillary Rodham, Democratic Party, Roe v Wade (Supreme Court Decision), Roman Catholic Church]	Q&A: How Democrats Can Stop Being Perceived as the Abortion Party	NyTimes
6	Male, I hesitate to think I have a right to speak on this issue.<br/>But, I have seen over many years in schools that children<br/>of lower and middle class status have to have babies they don't want or can't care for because they haven't access, money, or supportive family members who blame them for getting "knocked up."<br/>But, the kids from the posh part of towns have a weekend in Japan or Switzerland, or a special arrangement with a doctor, and that's that. They get to go on to college. Especially if they have messed with a high school athlete from the wrong class or color. The issue is as much social as religious. I cannot credit the thinking of those who want un-wanted kids in the world at the sacrifice of young women who make a mistake.  It seems to me the self-righteous among the pro-lifers want to punish the "girls." "Let he (or she) among you who is without<br/>sin cast the first stone (or vote)." And punish the poor, who, ironically, they otherwise say have too many babies.<br/>Women should decide this issue with their doctors and the<br/>busy-bodies should hole up somewhere.	[Abortion, Law and Legislation, Senate, Graham Lindsey, McConnell Mitch, Trump, Donald J]	The Political Dimensions of Medicine	NyTimes
7	It simply baffles me how anyone could vote for that old senile goof Joe Biden. He’s nothing but a career politician who never accomplished a thing to benefit the American people. You may not like “the man” Trump, but you can’t deny the many things he did for the American people and the love he has for our country. Ask yourself, “when is the last time you heard any democrat say something positive about America”? I’ll wait…..…	[Donald Trump,Joe Biden,Nevada,Pennsylvania,polling,polls,swing states]	Left-Wing Poll: Donald Trump Leads Joe Biden in Swing States Pennsylvania and Nevada	Breitbart
8	The only reason any of them are in the race is because they are all hoping Trump winds up in jail so they can have a shot a winning. Thats the only reason any of them are still hanging on. You have to admit watching Chriss ( Donut Boy ) Christy is fun to watch.	[Donald Trump,globalism,Globalists,Iowa,Nikki Haley]	Nikki Haley Cancels Iowa Event; Video Shows Empty Room	Breitbart
9	But there is zero causal relationship data and zero accurate predictive models that prove humans are causing it. Its only a theory based on an observed correlation, and a rather nebulous one at the moment.	['Climate Change,Global Warming,John Nolte']	Nolte: Study Blames Flight from Democrat-Run Cities on Climate Change	Breitbart
10	The climate change activists and politicians are not solving any problems, they are just creating problems and taking away freedoms/choices.	[climate alarmism,Climate Change,Global Warming,The Lancet]	Woke Lancet: Climate Change ‘the Biggest Global Health Threat of the 21st Century’	Breitbart
11	Life begins at conception. Every biologist will tell you that. If they dont, then they dont believe in their own science.	[Abortion,Catholic Church,gender theory,LGBT,Pope Francis,surrogacy,Vatican]	Pope Francis: Peace Begins with Respect for ‘the Life of the Unborn Child’	Breitbart
12	You mention European States. Most have come to a reasonable consensus balancing the rights of women with the rights of the unborn. So abortion is possible on certain grounds between around 12-24 weeks across Europe.	[2024 Presidential Election,Abortion,Nikki Haley,Republican Party]	Nikki Haley: State Legislatures Need to ‘Tweak’ Abortion Laws	Breitbart
